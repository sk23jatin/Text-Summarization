From August 1987 through March 1991, several airline incidents caused
a high death toll.  Crashes in Detroit, Albuquerque, Iowa, Ethiopia,
Mississippi, and Colorado killed 154, 5, 123, 16, 2 and 25,
respectively.  Also, a jetliner explosion over Scotland killed 181 and
another over Niger killed 171--both apparently terrorist acts.</SUM>
