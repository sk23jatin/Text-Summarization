Specialists at the National Hurricane Center monitored Atlantic storms
closely from 1988 - 1990. Using computer tracking models they advised
authorities to prepare for warning, evacuation and sheltering of
coastal populations.

Models were developed from satellite input and supercomputers.

Some hurricanes tracked between 1988 and 1990 were Gilbert, Hugo,
Chantal, Dean and Joan.</SUM>
