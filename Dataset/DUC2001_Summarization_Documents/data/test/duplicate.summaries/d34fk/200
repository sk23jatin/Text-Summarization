In June, 1988, meteorologist William Gray predicted severe east coast
storms this season.  Some concerns discussed at the Hurricane
Conference were early warning, evacuation and sheltering.

In September, Hurricane Gilbert, a category 5 storm, threatened the
Caribbean area with 175 mph winds.  This designation requires winds of
150 mph, pressure under 27.7 and great destructiveness, making Gilbert
the worst ever recorded.

In October, Hurricane Joan threatened Panama after striking Colombia.

In 1989 forecasters feared more hurricane damage as forecasting and
tracking capability decreased.  One satellite failed and
reconnaissance flights were threatened with curtailment.

Meteorologists reported that hurricane models are developed using
satellite data and computers; however, predicting intensity requires
reconnaissance.  Hugo's sudden upgrade was only detected by
reconnaissance.  Hugo's other lesson was that only because it struck a
sparsely populated area was disaster averted.

In August Hurricanes Chantal and Dean churned through the Gulf of
Mexico.

Dr. Gray said that African drought decreases hurricane activity, but
in 1990 he said increased rainfall there would increase frequency.
That year saw eight mild hurricanes, due, Dr. Gray said, to low
African rainfall.
  
Dr. Sheets predicted more hurricanes in the 90's and in 1991, experts
warned Miami is overdue for a hurricane.</SUM>
