Each year, tens of thousands of fires burn hundreds of thousands of
acres in national parklands and forests.  Lightening starts most of
them.  Government policy is to allow fires to burn themselves out,
except when they threaten towns or park buildings.  It often costs
millions of dollars to fight them.</SUM>
