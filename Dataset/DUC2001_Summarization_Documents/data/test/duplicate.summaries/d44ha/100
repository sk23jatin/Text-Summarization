Effective grassroots activism by labor and environmental groups and
public argument by Texas billionaire Ross Perot developed wide-ranging
public opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
based upon predictions that it would cause a massive flow of jobs from
the US to Mexico where lower wages, less satisfactory working
conditions, and less stringent environmental protection laws would
attract US industry. The Clinton administration negotiated protective
labor and environmental side agreements and diligently lobbied
Congress to overcome widespread opposition to the pact within his own
Democratic Party. Congress approved NAFTA in 1993.</SUM>
