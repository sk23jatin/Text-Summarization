Elizabeth Taylor was at St. John's Hospital in April, 1990 in Santa
Monica suffering from viral pneumonia, after transferring from a
smaller hospital where she was treated for sinusitis.

During her stay she underwent a lung biopsy and was placed in the ICU
with a ventilator to assist her breathing.  Her condition was
described as serious and her four children were at her side.  She
previously had a near-fatal bout with pneumonia in 1961.

Miss Taylor improved in a few days and was moved to a private room,
but her recovery was suddenly interrupted by the development of
bacterial pneumonia and a yeast infection which prolonged her hospital
stay by about six weeks.

Elizabeth Taylor has had health problems since a back injury in 1945.
She has been treated at the Betty Ford Clinic for a 35-year addiction
to sleeping pills, pain-killers and alcohol.  Her doctors were
recently investigated by the Los Angeles district attorney's office
for allegedly overprescribing the pills, but authorities declined to
press charges.

Miss Taylor, winner of two Oscars, later brought a lawsuit against the
National Enquirer who published rumors of her activities at the
hospital, including alleged drinking.  Miss Taylor won an apology, a
retraction and an undisclosed settlement.

Taylor has been married and divorced seven times.</SUM>
