Elizabeth Taylor was admitted to Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital on
April 9, 1990 with sinusitis, but moved to St. John's Medical Center
after she developed viral pneumonia about ten days later, where she
was treated with intravenous antibiotics.

On the 23rd of April she underwent a lung biopsy to determine the
cause of the pneumonia and was placed on a respirator and transferred
to the intensive care unit, her condition described as serious.  Her
four children were at her bedside, while doctors awaited biopsy
results.
  
Miss Taylor has suffered health problems since she injured her back in
a fall from a horse in 1945.  She has been treated for addictions to
pain killers, sleeping pills, food and alcohol.

Recently the Los Angeles district attorney's office declined to press
charges against physicians for Miss Taylor who allegedly
over-prescribed pain killers.  While agreeing that their prescription
practices fell below accepted standards, authorities said the doctors
had shown no criminal intent.

On April 26, a large crowd gathered at the hospital for news of her
condition.  Doctors reported that she had rallied and was no longer on
the ventilator, although she remained seriously ill in intensive care.

On May 11th, doctors revealed that Miss Taylor had developed bacterial
pneumonia and a yeast infection and would require six more weeks of
hospitalization for intravenous therapy.  They said she was out of
intensive care and doing well and that bacterial pneumonia was often a
complication of viral pneumonia.

They also revealed she had been near death on April 22.

The press conference was further evidence of public interest in the
life, triumphs and problems of Elizabeth Taylor.

In addition to her 1961 pneumonia, she has undergone twenty
surgeries. Acknowledged addictions to pain-killers and sleeping pills
have led to treatment at the Betty Ford Clinic.

Her life has been one of extremes: she won two Oscars, for
"Butterfield Eight" and "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf," during her
brilliant film career, which began as a young teenager in the 1940's.
But her attempts at marriage were not successful.  Seven marriages
ended in divorce.
  
Throughout her trials and triumphs, she has displayed a sense of humor
and great strength.

Miss Taylor later brought suit against the National Enquirer after
they printed an article suggesting that Miss Taylor had been drinking
during her hospital stay at St. John's.

The Enquirer settled for an undisclosed amount and an apology to the
actress.</SUM>
