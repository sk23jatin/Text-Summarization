Elizabeth Taylor was hospitalized in April, 1990, for virus pneumonia.
For a time she was in the intensive care unit in serious condition.
Later, bacterial pneumonia and a yeast infection further complicated
her recovery.

Miss Taylor has had bad health since a back injury in 1945.  She
admitted to 35 years of addiction to pain and sleeping pills and
alcohol, and had treatment at the Betty Ford Clinic.

Her doctors were investigated for overprescribing her medications, but
not prosecuted, and she initiated successful litigation against the
National Enquirer for inaccurate tabloid stories.

Taylor, 58, recipient of two Oscars, has been divorced seven
times.</SUM>
