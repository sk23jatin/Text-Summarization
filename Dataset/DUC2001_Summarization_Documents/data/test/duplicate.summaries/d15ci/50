Tuberculosis (TB) was killing 3 million people worldwide in 1990 and
increasing in Latvia in 1993.  By 1990 the number of cases in the
U.S. stopped declining.  AIDS patients, prisoners, blacks, office
workers, and the homeless, undernourished, or seriously ill are more
susceptible.  Testing, treatment, and building ventilation need to be
improved.</SUM>
