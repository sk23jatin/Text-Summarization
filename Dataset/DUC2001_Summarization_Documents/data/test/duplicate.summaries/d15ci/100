Tuberculosis (TB) is a highly contagious, but preventable and curable,
bacterial lung disease.  About 7% of Americans carry the bacteria, but
only about 10% develop an active infection.  In 1990, TB was killing 3
million people annually worldwide.  In 1993, cases and deaths
increased in Latvia.  By 1990 the number of cases in the United States
stopped declining.  AIDS patients, prisoners, the homeless, the
undernourished, office workers, those with serious illnesses, and
blacks are more susceptible.  To slow the spread, testing and
treatment are needed for prisoners, the homeless, substance abusers,
and AIDS patients.  Building ventilation needs to be improved.</SUM>
