Sixty-one percent of surveyed Americans, regardless of party, gender,
race, ideology or income, favor congressional term limits.  Why?
...Because it is almost impossible to defeat an incumbent.  Most
congressmen oppose the idea.  In the past three elections, 96% or more
of House incumbents who ran won.  It is political axiom that people
won't vote for someone they don't know.  Skewed campaign financing
laws combined with franking privileges enable incumbents to make
themselves known.  At the end of the 1988 elections, incumbents had
$63 million left over.  Challengers were able to raise and spend a
total of only $39 million.</SUM>

Nelson W. Polsby, Director of the Institute of Governmental Studies at
UC Berkeley, believes that constitutional changes to limit the terms
of elected federal and state officials won't accomplish their
purported goals.  They will not decrease the influence and money of
interest groups.  To the contrary, veteran legislators can better
handle these groups than can novices.  Limitations won't improve the
functioning of the legislature.  It takes time for legislators to
learn their jobs.  And limitations won't enhance representative
democracy.  It guarantees that good legislators will disappear along
with the bad.  It arbitrarily prevents voters from returning to office
those legislators they favor.</SUM>

Several states are considering term-limit restrictions for state
lawmakers.  Ross K. Baker, a political science professor at Rutgers
University, says this is illogical.  There is a lack of connection
between the fancied sins of the lawmakers and the discipline proposed.
A weakness of state legislatures often results from the amateurism of
the lawmakers, a trait now seen as a virtue.  Lobbyists and unelected
legislative staff would benefit.  They are permanent and outside the
accountability of voters.  If what reformers want is to throw out the
rascals, these measures are more like burning down your house to get
rid of the rats.</SUM>

Two propositions on California's November 6 ballot would limit the
terms of statewide officeholders.  The LA Times questioned six
legislators and legislative specialists about the effect in the state
and nationally if either or both passed.  One legislator and one
specialist would view passage as positive.  It would give people more
control over the Legislature, limit the influence of special
interests, prevent the creation of a career political elite and help
the parties.  The other legislator and three specialists would see
term limits as a negative.  It would cede power to the executive
branch, to bureaucrats and lobbyists, and would foster amateurish
incompetence.</SUM>

The idea of term limits for legislators is not new.  We once had them.
They kept James Madison out of legislative service at a critical time
during our early nation building years.  However, the constitutional
convention unanimously rejected them and the First Congress soundly
defeated two subsequent term-limit proposals.  Today we hear many of
the same pro and con arguments that were expressed then.  Robert
Livingston may have said it best, "The people are the best judges [of]
who ought to represent them.  To dictate and control them, to tell
them who they shall not elect, is to abridge their natural
rights."</SUM>

Focus groups indicate that the public believes Washington politicians
are more concerned with political self-preservation than with the
public good.  The electoral system is failing; thus the movement for
term limits.  The dissatisfaction is not ideological.  Voters are not
primarily concerned about more conservative or more liberal
representation.  They want more responsive representation.  Congress
must do a better job on key issues.  But some experts believe that
more fundamental change is needed.  The nexus of the problem ---
entrenched arrogance, more concern for special interests than the
people, and obsession with campaign contributions --- is the tenured
committee system.  This, too, must change.</SUM>

Experts are arguing the constitutionality of state-imposed
congressional term limits.  Those against limits say that neither
Congress nor the states may add to the age, citizenship and residency
qualifications set forth in the Constitution.  Those arguing for them
say that limits are not a qualification.  They do not prevent anyone
from having the opportunity to serve in Congress, nor do they prevent
voters from voting their ideology or party.  The California Supreme
Court has ruled that term limits for state officeholders is
constitutional.  The U.S. Supreme Court has reiterated that states,
via the Tenth Amendment, have "the power to regulate elections."</SUM>

Are term limits a crusade driven by only one party or ideology?  Many
believe the movement is GOP sponsored in order to oust incumbent
Democrats.  However, it is now picking up many prominent liberal and
Democratic supporters.  One reason is that it would help many people
such as blacks, other minorities and women, now excluded from office
by incumbents.  Democratic Party leadership still opposes term limits,
believing they would result in large GOP gains.  But, as a sign of the
times, term-limit opponents are now relying more on judges to stop the
movement than on trying to convince voters to reject the idea.</SUM>

Harvard Professor Robert J. Barro, after considering the many
arguments for or against congressional term limits, believes those
against far outweigh those in favor.  He believes the main inference
in a 95% re-election rate is that officeholders are satisfying their
constituents.  The only respectable argument for limits is that they
would disrupt the dysfunctional aspects of the seniority system.
Seniority provides better committee assignments, which lead to greater
special interest fund raising and the power to control government
largess, often dispersed at the expense of districts represented by
junior legislators.  Committee term limits may improve the functioning
of government.</SUM>

Edward W. Crane, President, Cato Institute, argues that 75% of
Americans support term limitation because they recognize it as an
opportunity for citizens to wrest control of government from an
impervious Congress full of professional politicians.  Incumbent
legislators have carefully crafted a web of perks and privileges that
make challenging them a futile crusade.  Once elected, officeholders
are corrupted by the "culture of ruling" that permeates Washington.
They lose common sense and begin believing their opinion is more
important than it really is.  A true "citizen Congress" would be
comprised of legislators on a temporary leave-of-absence from real
world work, not career politicians.</SUM>
