Many Americans believe that career Washington politicians are mostly
concerned with their self-preservation.  During the prior three
elections 96% or more of House incumbents who ran for reelection won.
Furthermore, their perks and privileges make challenging them futile.
A solution to this problem is term limits.  However, some political
scientists believe term limits is a cure that's worse than the disease
and may be unconstitutional.  Still others think the fundamental
problem is not incumbency, but rather the tenured, seniority committee
system, which leads to entrenched arrogance, greater special interest
fund raising and attention.  Perhaps the term limits should only be on
committee assignments.</SUM>
