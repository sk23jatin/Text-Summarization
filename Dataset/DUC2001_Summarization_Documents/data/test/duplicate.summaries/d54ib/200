Sixty-one percent of Americans favor congressional term limits.  Why?
Because average citizens believe that Washington politicians are more
concerned with political self- preservation than with the public good.
During the prior three elections 96% or more of House incumbents who
ran for re-election won.  People feel that incumbent legislators have
perks and privileges that make challenging them a futile effort.
Therefore, the only solution is term limits.

Many political scientists believe term limits is a cure that's worse
than the disease.  They argue that neither the states nor Congress may
add to the age, citizenship and residency qualifications set forth in
the Constitution.  However, the U.S. Supreme Court has reiterated that
states, via the Tenth Amendment, have "the power to regulate
elections".

Some people think the crux of the problem is the tenured, seniority
committee system, which leads to entrenched arrogance, greater special
interest fund raising and the power to control government largess.
Perhaps term limits on committee assignments would address voters
concerns and negate the need for officeholder term limits.  But there
will always be those who believe that a true "citizens Congress"
should be comprised of legislators on temporary leave-of-absence from
real world work, and not by career politicians.</SUM>
