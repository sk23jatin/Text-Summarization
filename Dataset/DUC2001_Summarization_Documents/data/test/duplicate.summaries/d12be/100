There was a critical need for reform of the U. S. welfare system
during the Reagan and Clinton administrations.  Several million
families were in a poverty-dependency status, welfare consumed huge
sums with no improvement, and public pressure increased.

Both presidents worked closely with the governors.  Changes focused on
the need for welfare recipients to work.  The House of
Representatives, however, paid lip service to reform.

The two administrations encouraged the states to initiate their own
reform plans.  These included time limits on welfare checks.

Meanwhile, overseas, the capitalist nations were also having their own
problems with spiraling welfare costs.</SUM>
