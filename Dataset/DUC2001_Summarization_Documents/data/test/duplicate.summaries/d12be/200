The welfare situation in the U.S. during the Reagan and Clinton
administrations required these two presidents to assign a priority to
welfare reform.  Several million families were caught in a cycle of
chronic poverty and dependency.  The welfare rolls were increasing at
an alarming rate.  The cost to the public was enormous and there was
pressure to bring about reform.

President Reagan and the governors agreed that welfare recipients
would work for their welfare checks.  The House of Representatives,
however, wanted to leave the requirement to work to the state and
local governments. Other House bills paid only lip service to
reform. Reformers insisted on shrinking the welfare rolls.

The Clinton administration reform efforts centered on job training for
the unemployed and also the requirement that people work for a welfare
check.  The administration approved two state plans as pilot programs
to get reform off the ground.  One limited aid for two years.  The
other reduced payments to all able-bodied adults who refused to work
and denied increases to families on long-term welfare who had more
children.

The U.S. was not alone in its welfare predicament.  Other capitalist
economies in general were all faced with spiraling welfare
costs.</SUM>
