An estimated $20 billion dollars in damage caused by Hurricane Andrew
could generate up to $7.3 billion in claims, making this the costliest
year ever for the US property- casualty industry.  Most damage
occurred in south Florida.  Very little of the loss is covered by
foreign reinsurers.  Government relief efforts are underway.</SUM>
