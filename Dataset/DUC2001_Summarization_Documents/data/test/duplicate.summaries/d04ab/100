Damage caused by Hurricane Andrew could reach $20 billion, making it
the costliest storm this century.  The greatest toll was in south
Florida, particularly in the town of Homestead, which was largely
flattened.  Less damage occurred in Louisiana.  Even though much of
the loss was not insured, payments for this storm could total $7.3
billion, which coupled with $3.9 billion of prior industry losses,
will make this the costliest year in US property-casualty industry
history.  Foreign reinsurance companies carry little of the loss.
President Bush, after a poor initial start, has intensified efforts to
bring aid to those affected.</SUM>
