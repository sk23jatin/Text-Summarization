Throughout 1988 and into 1989, over 31,000 wildfires burned over
1,111,000 acres in national parks, forests, and wilderness areas in
twelve Western states, Michigan Kentucky, Tennessee, and Georgia.  A
moratorium was declared on the "natural burn" policy and by mid-1989
rain and higher humidity helped firefighters contain the major
fires.</SUM>
