Congress is debating whether or not to count illegal aliens in the
1990 census.  Congressional House seats are apportioned to the states
and huge sums of federal money are allocated based on census
population.  California, with an estimated half of all illegal aliens,
will be greatly affected.

Those arguing for inclusion say that the Constitution does not mention
"citizens", but rather, instructs that House apportionment be based on
the "whole number of persons" residing in the various states.  Those
opposed say that the framers were unaware of this issue.  "Illegal
aliens" did not exist in the U.S. until restrictive immigration laws
were passed in 1875.</SUM>
