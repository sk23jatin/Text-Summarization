On March 24, 1989, the Exxon Valdez ran aground in Prince William
Sound, Alaska, and spilled 11.3 million gallons of crude oil.  By
April, a disaster area was declared, the herring season was cancelled,
an investigation of rising gasoline prices was called for, a boycott
of Exxon was begun, and the slick covered an area the size of
Delaware.  Clean- up operations stopped on September 15, with 117
miles of beach still oily.  In early 1990, Exxon announced a drop in
earnings and an almost $2 billion spill price tag.  The cleanup was to
resume on May 1.</SUM>
