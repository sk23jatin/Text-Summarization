In 1988, the United States suffered one of its worst droughts ever.
The Agriculture Department attempted to shore up meat prices with
purchases.  Prices were depressed due to the drought-induced
liquidation of herds.  It also allowed emergency haying and grazing in
conservation and reserve acreage lands.  Congress then passed a record
$3.9 billion drought relief bill, which helped thousands of farmers
nationwide.  North Dakota, along with Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota and
Wisconsin received nearly half of the allocated aid.  A 1990 study
showed that because of high 1988 commodity prices there were no
significant ill affects for farmers despite the drought.</SUM>
