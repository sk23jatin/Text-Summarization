The second amendment to the Constitution generated much debate before
adoption and two hundred years later scholars still argue its ultimate
intent.  While the amendment prohibits the federal government from
barring private ownership of arms, it does not prevent the federal
government from some gun control.  The Brady Bill was passed after
seven years despite strong opposition from the National Rifle
Association which label it as an inconvenience and ineffective.  Brady
supporters concede that the bill will make only a small dent in gun
sales.  Both supporters and opponents of gun control measures plan to
increase lobbying efforts in support of their positions.</SUM>
