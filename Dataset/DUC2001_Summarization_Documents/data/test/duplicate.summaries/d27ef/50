The Second Amendment to the Constitution is a subject of debate by
opponents and proponents of gun control.  While gun ownership by
citizens is guaranteed by the amendment, it does not bar the federal
government from enacting some gun control or regulation. Congress
passed the Brady Bill despite strong opposition from gun
advocates.</SUM>
