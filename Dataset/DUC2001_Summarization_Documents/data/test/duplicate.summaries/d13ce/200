Clarence Thomas, a black conservative republican, was confirmed as a
Supreme Court justice on 16 October 1991.

Thomas was born of humble beginnings in Pinpoint, Georgia in 1948.
His father deserted the family and he was brought up by
grandparents. He attended a catholic school in Georgia and from there
went on to a seminary. Discovering racial prejudice here, he left
Georgia for Holy Cross College in Worcester, Massachusetts, graduating
in 1971. He then finished Yale Law School in 1974. It was during his
law school years that he changed his political views from liberal to
conservative. He became a critic of affirmative action and racial
preferences for minority groups.

He worked as an attorney and moved to Washington in 1974. Thomas was
appointed to several civil rights and equal employment opportunity
positions beginning in the early 1980s and as a judge in the
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1990.

One journalist believed that Thomas "made it" because he was helped
all his life by affirmative action. His confirmation as a justice of
the Supreme Court brought joy to his mother in Pinpoint, Georgia. She
believed that the charge of sexual harassment against her son was a
false charge.</SUM>
