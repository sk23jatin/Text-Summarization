Marathon racing was a poplar sport from 1989 to 1991, drawing both
professionals and amateurs.  Men, women, and wheelchair users compete
in the 26.2-mile race, or shorter runs, such as half marathons.
Thirteen thousand were expected to vie in the 1991 Boston Marathon,
including an 83 year-old man running the race for his 60th time.  This
race offered $402,000 in prize money.  The winners' prizes varied in
individual marathons.  In 1989, Chicago's paid $50,000, while San
Diego's paid $5,000.  Competitors in the U.S.  marathons come from all
over the world.  African runners, especially Ethiopians, are
successful, as are Northern European women.  West coast races seem to
draw more Asians and Mexicans.  Winners' times for the races can vary
by 5 minutes based on the course terrain, weather conditions, and
competitors.  Wheelchair winners can finish under 2 hours, with the
men's winner about 10 minutes later and the women's winner 20 minutes
after that.  By 1989, marathon vacations were popular, with tour
companies offering packages, which included entry fees, to locations
worldwide.  In 1990, one company took 5,500 people on 20 marathon
tours.  At least one man in 1991 planned to run his marathon around
the deck of a battleship.</SUM>
