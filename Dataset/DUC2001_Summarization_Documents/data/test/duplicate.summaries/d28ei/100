From 1989 to 1991, professionals and amateurs competed in marathons
and half- marathons.  Competitors in the U.S. marathons came from all
over the world.  Winners' prize money and times for the races varied.
Wheelchair winners could do the 26.2-mile course in less than 2 hours,
with the men's and women's winners taking about 10 and 30 minutes
more, respectively.  By 1989, tour companies were offering worldwide
marathon vacations.  Unusual 1991 marathoners included an 83 year-old
man expected to run his 60th Boston Marathon with 13,000 others and a
man planning to run his marathon on the deck of a battleship.</SUM>
