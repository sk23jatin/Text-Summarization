Canadian Ben Johnson won the 100-meter dash at the 1988 Olympics but
afterward tested positive for illegal steroid use.  He was stripped of
his gold medal, suspended from competition for two years, and banned
from Canada's team for life.  A teammate said Johnson's physician had
provided steroids to her and Johnson with the knowledge of their
coach.  After his suspension was over, Johnson entered a track meet in
Canada where he finished second in the 50-meter dash.  In 1991, his
coach testified that he had given athletes every steroid combination
imaginable.  His system worked until the Johnson incident in Seoul
1988.</SUM>
