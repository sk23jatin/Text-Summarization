Canadian Ben Johnson won the 100-meter dash at the 1988 Olympics but
was stripped of his medal when he tested positive for illegal steroid
use.  A teammate said Johnson's physician had provided steroids to her
and Johnson with their coach's knowledge.  In 1991, the coach admitted
giving his team illegal steroids.</SUM>
