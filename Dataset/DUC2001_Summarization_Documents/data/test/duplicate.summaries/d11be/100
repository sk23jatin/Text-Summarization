Weather records have contained valuable information concerning the
pattern of tornadoes in the U.S.

Spring in Texas and the U.S. heartland brings the tornado season.
Weather officials advise people to have safety plans.

Madison, Florida can attest to the fury of a tornado, having been a
victim in 1988.

Tetsuya Fujita, a science professor in 1990, became prominent for
development of a tornado measuring device and for deployment of
doppler radar to enable aircraft to avoid dangerous air
