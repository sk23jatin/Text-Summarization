Most tornadoes occur according to a pattern of locations and times.
Texas and the U.S. heartland are the prime locations for tornado
occurrence and noon to 6 P.M. is the most common time.  Tornadoes, on
fewer occasions, have ranged beyond these parameters.

Experts have developed equipment to improve detection and
