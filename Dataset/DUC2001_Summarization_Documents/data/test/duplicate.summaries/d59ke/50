Airlines and private owners had a number of air disasters during the
period 1960 to 1991.  Causes of these crashes were terrorists,
mechanical failures, pilot errors and weather.  Aircraft types ranged
from the largest, a Boeing 747, to the smallest, a Cessna.

The casualties prompted a call for improved safety measures.</SUM>
