Domestic and foreign airlines as well as private aircraft suffered a
number of air crashes during the 1960-1991 period.  Causes were
terrorists, mechanical failures, pilot errors and weather.

Terrorist bombs destroyed a Boeing 747 and a DC-10 in mid-air.  A
Boeing 737 crew shut down a functioning engine instead of a
mal-functioning one.  The pilot of another plane accidentally flew it
into a mountain.

Crashes due to weather included a Boeing 737 caught in wind shear.

A MD-82 crashed because of engine failure.  Another aircraft had
multiple failures.

Loss of life and injuries brought pressure for a review of safety
measures.</SUM>
