In 1992 and 1993, the North American Free Trade Agreement to establish
free trade among the United States, Canada and Mexico was a
controversial issue.  Its supporters-- the administration, business
leaders and the republican establishment--spent millions of dollars.
Opponents, running a grassroots operation, included labor, many
democrats, U.S. Hispanics and blacks, and ultra-conservatives.  Public
support, low through September 1993, began to rise after packages were
added and Vice-president Gore debated Ross Perot.  As the ratification
vote grew near, both sides accelerated efforts.  Clinton's credibility
and effectiveness became tied to ratification.  Following
ratification, Caribbean basin nations awaited its impact.</SUM>
