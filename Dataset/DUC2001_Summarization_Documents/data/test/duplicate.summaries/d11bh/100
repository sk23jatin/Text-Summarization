Tornadoes, violently twisting winds reaching down from thunderclouds,
increase in March and are most common in May and June between 3 and
6pm. They occur most often in parts of large thunderstorms adjacent to
hail. Tornado deaths are decreasing with greater public awareness and
better warning. A tornado watch means conditions are suitable for
tornado development. A warning means one has developed. In case of a
tornado, go underground or to a central part of a building, present a
low profile and cover your head. If in a car or mobile home, leave it
for a safe shelter or low area.</SUM>
