Tornadoes, violently twisting winds reaching down from thunderclouds,
are most common in May and June from 3-6pm. A tornado watch means
conditions are suitable. A warning means one has developed. In case of
a tornado, go underground or to a building's center. If in a car or
mobile home, leave it.</SUM>
