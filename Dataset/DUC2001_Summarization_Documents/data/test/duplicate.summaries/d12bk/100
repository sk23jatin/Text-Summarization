Presidents Reagan and Clinton struggled with the welfare system during
the late eighties and early nineties, mandated by an indignant public.

Both agreed that the able-bodied should work for their checks, and
included job-training in their proposals.

The governors were asked to experiment with welfare reforms in their
states.

President Reagan's 1987 welfare proposal was criticized because only
25 percent of expenditures were earmarked for welfare-to-work
provisions.

President Clinton took up welfare reform in 1993, including training
and work requirements.

Internationally, other welfare states sought solutions for debt
resulting from welfare, health and pension schemes which will mushroom
in the future.</SUM>
