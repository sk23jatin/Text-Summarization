From 1987 to 1993, hunger was endemic in much of the world with one
billion people living on less than $1 a day.  The Third World debt was
huge and had untenable debt service fees.  Although some blamed the
Third World governments, developed nations were asked to cancel or
reschedule debts and increase financial aid.  In 1987, some small
U.S. banks were writing off loans.  The World Bank was expected to
take the lead and gradually moved from being a development institution
to one with programs that were directed at easing poverty and helping
the environment.  Privately administered micro- enterprise lending had
some success.</SUM>
