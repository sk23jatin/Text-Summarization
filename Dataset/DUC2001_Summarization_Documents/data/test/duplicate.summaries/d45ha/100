Despite worsening relations with the federal government of Yugoslavia
and its dominant republic, Serbia, the communist republic of Slovenia
continued to push for sovereignty within a looser confederation of
sovereign states and in the spring of 1990 held the first free
elections in Yugoslavia in 45 years. The resulting non-Communist
government declared Slovenia's full sovereignty and after months of
unsuccessful negotiation with the other five republics formally
seceded from the federation in June of 1991. After a short occupation
by federal troops the Slovenian government negotiated a peace
agreement and proceeded with its business of economic recovery as a
market-oriented, multi-party parliamentary democracy.</SUM>
