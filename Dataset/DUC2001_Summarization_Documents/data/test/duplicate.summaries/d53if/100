Shining Path ("Sendero Luminoso") had its strength with coca-growing
farmers but hoped to extend its power into the cities among Peru's
poor.  The Maoist guerrilla organization had protected the farmers
from anti-drug police but demanded a fifth of their profits and
imposed stringent rules with harsh penalties.  Shining Path combined
political and terrorist tactics in the cities.  Several of the
organization's leaders were imprisoned and proposed peace between the
guerrillas and government to end the war which had cost 20,000 lives.
But one group of Shining Path leaders not in prison vowed to continue
its struggle.</SUM>
