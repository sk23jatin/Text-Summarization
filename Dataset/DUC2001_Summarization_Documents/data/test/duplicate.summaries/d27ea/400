In November 1993 the Congress of the United States, after seven long
years of debate, passed the Brady Bill requiring a five-day waiting
period prior to the purchase of a handgun to give authorities time to
check on the background of the purchaser. This was the first
significant national gun-control law to be enacted since the
assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy in
1968. One battle was over, but the war had not been won. The fight
against any meaningful form of gun control had been spearheaded by
leaders of the National Rifle Association (NRA), an organization that
increased its membership by 700,000 in the two years prior to passage
of the Brady Bill. The NRA immediately went to work fighting any
further gun-control laws and seeking electoral defeat of legislators
who supported any such measures. The debate went on, centered, as it
always had been, on the exact meaning of the Second Amendment to the
United States Constitution.

The Second Amendment states: "A well regulated militia, being
necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to
keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed." Opponents of gun control
argue that the amendment spells out an individual right of American
citizens to own and possess firearms without government
interference. Proponents of gun control say the reference to a "well
regulated militia" shows that it concerns only the states' right to
maintain militias without interference from the federal
government. Opponents answer: "Since everyone agrees that the right of
the people' elsewhere in the Bill of Rights means a right for
individual citizens, why in the case of the Second Amendment should it
mean just a state's right to be protected from the federal
government?" The Supreme Court's decisions, while not definitive, tend
to support the position that it pertains to the states' right to have
militias.

Aside from the Second Amendment, gun-control advocates point to the
proliferation of handguns and assault weapons and the high levels of
violent crime in the United States while opponents assert that
criminals aren't affected by gun-control laws and the possession of
weapons is the individual's only means of self-protection and defense
against tyranny. The NRA president was quoted as saying, "But look at
what happened in Germany when ol' Hitler did a good job in disarming
the nation." The debate goes on.</SUM>
