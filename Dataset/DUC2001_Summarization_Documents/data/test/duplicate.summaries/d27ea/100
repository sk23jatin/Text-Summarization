Passage of the Brady Bill was a victory for advocates of gun control,
but opponents, headed by the National Rifle Association, remain a
potent force. The debate continues; much of it is centered on the
meaning of the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Does it
guarantee each individual's right to own and use firearms without
interference from government or does it simply protect states' right
to maintain a militia without interference from the federal
government? The Supreme Court has yet to give a final answer. One side
decries firearm violence while the other defends possession of guns
for self-protection and defense against tyranny.</SUM>
