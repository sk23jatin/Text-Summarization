U. S Military aircraft vary in purpose, size, speed, technology and
age.  They operate from a multitude of airbases around the world and
aircraft carriers at sea.  Flying them can be dangerous, even fatal.
Aircraft crashes are not uncommon.  Some are reported each year from
throughout the world.

Fortuitous is the crash that occurs at sea after the pilot has bailed
out.  No fatalities, injuries or damage other than the loss of an
aircraft.  More problematic is the accident in a densely populated
area involving many fatalities and injuries.  There is public outcry
and mourning.  Then the flights continue.</SUM>
