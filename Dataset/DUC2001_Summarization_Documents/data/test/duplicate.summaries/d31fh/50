Jamaican-born Ben Johnson, 26, won a gold medal for Canada at the 1988 Olympics for 
his record 9.79-second 100-meter dash. He forfeited the medal and all records and was 
suspended from competition when tests showed his steroid use. Johnson later admitted 
steroid use since 1981 when a teammate and coach confirmed it.</SUM>
