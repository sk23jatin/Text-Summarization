Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, 26, is accused of using the illegal anabolic steroid 
Stanozolol after his urine sample proved positive for drugs. He was stripped of the 
Olympic gold medal won three days ago for running the world's fastest 100-meter dash, 
automatically suspended from international competition for two years, and banned from 
Canada's national team for life. Johnson denies any drug use and left for Toronto in 
shock. His sister Clare Rodney refuses to believe the accusation. His coach suggests a 
drink of Johnson's was spiked. Johnson had been a hero to many sports fans in Canada, 
his native Jamaica, and around the world.</SUM>

Jamaican-born sprinter Ben Johnson broke the record for the 100-yard dash Saturday 
with his 9.79-second finish but was stripped of the Olympic gold medal he won for 
Canada when his post-win urine sample suggested he had used anabolic steroids to 
enhance his performance. The Canadian government suspended him from Canada's 
national team for life, pending an appeal. Johnson's family and a teammate from the 1984 
Olympics denied Johnson had used drugs. Sports Minister Jean Charest acknowledged 
hearing a rumor several months earlier that Johnson might be using steroids. Johnson was 
last tested in Canada in February at a Montreal laboratory.</SUM>

Sprinter Ben Johnson, 26, surrendered his Olympic gold medal for running the 100-meter 
dash in 9.79 seconds, a world record, after the muscle-building illegal steroid Stanozolol 
was found in his system. He said only that he still had his family's love and suggested 
someone was pleased his medal had been taken away. His personal physician, Dr. George 
Astaphan, denied dispensing steroids.  Johnson tested negative for drugs in August and 
passed eight tests in two years. Johnson's father, Ben Johnson, Sr., lives in Falmouth, 
Jamaica and Johnson's sister Claire Rodney and mother Gloria, to whom he had 
dedicated his medal, live in suburban Toronto.</SUM>

26-year old Jamaican transplant to Canada Ben Johnson won an Olympic gold medal on 
Saturday when he ran the 100 meters in a world record time of 9.79 seconds. Johnson 
dedicated the medal to his mother and all Canadian citizens. The medal was taken away 
when Johnson tested positive for Stanozolol, an illegal muscle-building steroid. He had 
earlier been awarded the Order of Canada and a medal from Queen Elizabeth at the 
Commonwealth Games. He flew home to Canada in the seclusion of the cockpit and 
hurdled a hedge with a jacket over his head to duck reporters.</SUM>

Ben Johnson was stripped of his Olympic gold medal in the 100-meter final after testing 
positive for the banned steroid Stanozolol. Teammate Angella Issajenko says she too took 
Stanozolol and claims Johnson also took steroids when he set a 9.83-second world sprint 
record last summer in Rome, and those close to him were aware he knowingly took them. 
Dr. George Mario Astaphan provided steroids and monitored the program from 1984 to 
1986, with the knowledge of coach Charlie Francis of the Mazda Optimist Track Club, to 
which both Issajenko and Johnson belonged. Johnson went to Astaphan on his own after 
that.</SUM>

Ben Johnson's personal physician, Dr. Jamie Astaphan, said the Olympic sprinter took a 
banned steroid on one occasion last May, four months before the Seoul Olympics, when 
he was depressed by a hamstring injury that threatened to end his rivalry against Carl 
Lewis for the 100-meter gold medal. Astaphan claimed Johnson bought Stanozolol or 
somebody bought it for him in Toronto, but immediately after taking it he suffered 
violent muscle spasms and was brought to Astaphan, who nursed him back to top 
condition. Johnson says he never knowingly took performance-enhancing drugs and 
Astaphan denies prescribing them for any Canadian Olympic athletes.</SUM>

Carl Lewis said Ben Johnson demonstrated he was taking performance-enhancing drugs 
at the Seoul Olympics by coming out of the blocks for the 100-meter final like a caged 
lion after running preliminary heats. Johnson's gold medal and Seoul world-record time 
were both revoked when his drug test was positive for the banned anabolic steroid 
Stanozolol. Supposedly, an unidentified man seen talking with Lewis sabotaged the beer 
provided to facilitate urine samples. Johnson's world record of 9.83 seconds at the 1987 
World Championships at Rome stands because he passed a drug test after that race. 
Johnson took the steroid Furazabol three weeks before the Olympics.</SUM>

Canadian coach Charlie Francis has claimed that a mysterious person may have slipped a 
banned steroid into sprinter Ben Johnson's beverage in the drug-testing area before the 
urine test at the Seoul Olympics. But according to acquaintance Lynda Huey, Francis 
bragged about Johnson's preparations for a showdown against US sprinter Carl Lewis. 
Francis allegedly said, "Ben's more afraid of failing the drug test than he is of Carl 
Lewis." Francis has been in Toronto testifying at a Canadian inquiry into drug use in 
sports and said Johnson was clean at the Olympics, that he was not taking the steroid 
Stanozolol before the Games.</SUM>

Ben Johnson admitted his steroid use this week at a Canadian inquiry. He testified that 
his seven-year involvement with illegal performance-enhancing drugs included injections 
before the 1987 World Championships in Rome, where he set the world record of 9.83 
seconds, although his test results afterward were negative. Johnson clocked 9.79 at the 
Seoul Olympics but lost that record and his gold medal and was barred from competition 
for two years after testing positive for an anabolic steroid. Opponent Carl Lewis thinks 
Johnson should be allowed back into competition after his suspension because he finally 
told the truth and has spoken out against drugs.</SUM>

World-class sprinter Ben Johnson got knocked off track and field's pedestal and lost his 
gold medal in Seoul after testing positive for muscle-building steroids. At a news 
conference Thursday, as legislation was introduced to classify anabolic steroids as a 
controlled substance, Johnson told reporters it's wrong for athletes to use them, that 
they're bad for your health and it's wrong to cheat. Johnson was invited to attend by 
Representatives Mel Levine, Henry Waxman and Benjamin Gilman, presenters of the 
legislation, who applauded Johnson's courage in attending. Johnson later took the 
microphone and urged other athletes not to make the same mistake he did.</SUM>

Two years ago, 100-meter record-holder Ben Johnson lost his gold medal after testing 
positive for anabolic steroids at the Seoul Olympics. He was given a two-year suspension 
from competition which ends today. The Hamilton Spectator Indoor Games January 11th 
will mark his return to competition. He will receive $10,000 Canadian to appear. He 
received $60,000 to race in Stockholm and will receive $30,000 to appear in the January 
18th Sunkist invitational. Loren Seagrave replaced Charlie Francis as Johnson's coach. 
Adopting a rule in his name, the IAAF erased all Johnson's 1983-1989 times. Johnson 
has trained hard and believes he will return to his 1988 form.</SUM>

Ben Johnson's return to racing Friday, after losing an Olympic gold medal on Sept. 24, 
1988 and being suspended for two years because of a positive drug test, drew a record 
crowd of 17,050 and 500 journalists from 14 countries. Johnson received a standing 
ovation when introduced. He got off to a slow start and finished second. It was his first 
indoor loss in 11 meets dating to 1987. His time then of 5.55 seconds for 50 meters is still 
listed as the record. His upper body is less bulky now and his face is less puffy. He still 
weighs 174 pounds and bench-presses 365.</SUM>

On Sept. 24, 1988, Ben Johnson, who immigrated to Toronto from Jamaica as a scrawny 
14-year-old, set a world record and won a gold medal for running 100 meters in 9.79 
seconds at the Seoul Olympics. After testing positive for illegal steroid use, Johnson's 
gold medal and record were revoked. In a book, former Johnson coach Charlie Francis 
says he gave athletes every steroid combination imaginable and they all wanted to use 
them, and Johnson harmed his times by jubilantly raising his hand as he approached the 
finish line. Johnson is running again after a two-year suspension, attempting a comeback 
for the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.</SUM>
