Last year the U.S. Forest service said 5 million acres were charred in
raging wildfires including 706,000 Acres in Yellowstone National Park.
The Forest and National Park Service spent a combined $300 million
fighting the summer fires. Other hard hit areas included Alaska,
California, Montana and Idaho.  Foresters are waiting to see where and
when the fires will start this season.</SUM>
