The public has always shown interest in Elizabeth Taylor. The media
has zeroed in on her seven marriages, her four children, and
especially, her illnesses and addictions. Her health has been an issue
since early in her Academy Award-winning career. She has endured
several back operations. Addictions to pain-killing drugs twice forced
her into a treatment facility. Alcohol abuse and over-eating have
plagued her for years. A 1990 life- threatening viral pneumonia, her
latest illness, hospitalized her for two months. There were false
rumors that she had AIDS. She was wrongfully accused of heavy drinking
while hospitalized.</SUM>
