Elizabeth Taylor won Academy Awards for her performances in Who's
Afraid of Virginia Woolf?". Her brilliant Hollywood career seems to be
on the wane, but her stardom has not been diminished. The public has
always demonstrated an insatiable interest in all aspects of her
life. Her seven rocky marriages to six men have been fodder for the
tabloids. Maria Burton-Carson, Liza Todd-Tivey, and Christopher and
Michael Wilding, her four children from those marriages, have been of
interest to fans of the actress.

Nothing has generated more attention than the health and well-being of
the actress who was 58 years old in 1990. During the filming of
"National Velvet" in 1945 she fell from a horse, and that triggered a
lifetime of back problems. She underwent several back operations, and
her back woes have played a role in her addiction to pain-killing
drugs.  Respiratory problems have plagued her. In 1961 she survived a
near-fatal bout with pneumonia. Her battles with alcohol and
over-eating have been widely publicized. In 1983 she acknowledged a
35-year addiction to pain-killing drugs and sleeping pills, and
underwent addiction treatment at the Betty Ford Clinic, and in 1988
she returned for a second stay.

The public appetite for news about Ms. Taylor's health was exemplified
in the attention given to her latest hospitalization that started on
April 9, 1990 and carried through May.  Reports on her condition were
generally issued through her New York publicist, but sometimes by her
physicians. She was admitted to the Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital in
Santa Monica, suffering with a sinus infection. Viral pneumonia was
later diagnosed, and she was transferred to St. John's Hospital and
Health Center. She was put in intensive care, and placed on a
ventilator. Later, while she was recovering, her doctors acknowledged
that she was near death on April 22nd. With her recovery well along
and discharge from the hospital imminent she contracted bacterial
pneumonia and developed a blood infection. Those setbacks were not
life-threatening, but the need for intravenous therapy kept her in the
hospital for another six weeks. There were unfounded rumors that
Ms. Taylor had AIDS. The National Enquirer reported that she had been
drinking heavily while hospitalized. Taylor sued the tabloid and was
rewarded with a cash settlement and an apology.</SUM>
