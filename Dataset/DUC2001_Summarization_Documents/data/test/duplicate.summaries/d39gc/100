The 31-mile tunnel, called the "chunnel" links Calais and
Folkestone. It was scheduled to open in May 1994. The arduous
construction work that started in 1987 cost over 16 billion dollars,
and resulted in nine deaths. The construction was financed by private
capital, and was directed by a consortium of British and French
companies. Contrary to the prevailing sentiment in France, the English
were much opposed to the "chunnel".  They regard it as a threat to
their island identity. The "chunnel" will cut rail ravel time between
London and Paris to three and one-half hours.</SUM>
