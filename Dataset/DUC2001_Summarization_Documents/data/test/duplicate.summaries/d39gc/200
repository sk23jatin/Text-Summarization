In 1802 Napoleon talked about a tunnel under the English Channel, but
his idea went nowhere. Since that time there have been several
abortive attempts toward that goal. The imminent approach of free
trade in Europe impelled the Britain and France toward a treaty
authorizing a tunnel. The tunnel, soon known as the "chunnel" would be
built by the TransManche Link, a consortium of British and French
companies. A service tunnel and two one-way train tunnels would extend
for 31 miles, from near Calais to near Folkestone, with 23 miles under
the seabed.

France supported tunnel construction, and expected it to benefit the
economy in its northeast sector. Most English were opposed to the
tunnel, claiming its insular identity would be threatened by a host of
continental afflictions.

Tunnel construction started in 1987. Progress was slow and formal
opening ceremonies weren't scheduled until May 6, 1994. Construction
costs totaled at least 16.4 billion dollars. Nine construction workers
were killed. The projected rail travel time from London to Paris would
be lowered to three and one-half hours. Values for property near the
terminals on both sides of the channel are expected to increase.</SUM>
