An abnormal protein (prion) that eats holes in the brain causes
spongiform encephalopathy (SE) diseases.  Since the 1700's, one SE
disease (scrapies) attacked British sheep.  Cattle that ate feed
containing sheep by-products began dying from "mad cow disease" in
1986.  By 1990, the British beef industry was under siege, with
several nations imposing import restrictions and domestic consumption
down.  By 1994 more than 120,00 cattle and a few other animals had
died in the UK from "mad cow" and the European Union was considering
import bans.  Researchers were looking for a causal relationship
between "mad cow disease" and SE diseases that rarely afflict
man.</SUM>
