In June 1988, the Reagan administration moved to deal with a drought
plaguing most of the nation by appointing an interagency group,
monitoring the situation, and issuing activity reports.
  
By mid-July, the drought had shifted from the Rockies to the
Mid-Atlantic, affecting 29% of the nation.  President Reagan signed a
$3.9 billion relief program that eventually, due partly to lax rules,
became a windfall for thousands of farmers who received cash for
normal trials of nature.  Nevertheless, the aid did reach to most
needy areas, especially North Dakota.  Crop yields plummeted but
commodity prices rose and farm solvency still improved.</SUM>
