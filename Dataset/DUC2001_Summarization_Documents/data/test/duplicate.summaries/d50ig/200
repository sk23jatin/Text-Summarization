In June 1988, the Reagan administration moved to deal with a drought
plaguing most of the nation.  An interagency group was appointed and
the Agriculture Department said it had been on top of the drought
since March, monitoring the situation and issuing activity reports.

By mid-July, the drought had shifted eastward from the Rockies to the
Mid-Atlantic with little relief in sight and affecting 29% of the
nation.  In August, the Agriculture Department confirmed the drought
would curtail the Fall corn harvest by one-third, resulting in higher
prices.  Actually, crop stockpiles were so high there was no fear of
shortages on grocery shelves or discontinuance of food exporting.
Also, President Reagan signed a $3.9 billion drought relief program to
help the farmers.  By the end of 1989, the program, due partly to lax
rules, became a windfall for thousands of farmers who collected cash
for normal trials of nature.  The drought hit hardest in the Midwest
with most relief going to North Dakota.  Despite the overly generous
aid, money reached the most needy areas.  In late 1990, the
Agriculture Department reported the drought was not as bad as
expected.  Crop yields plummeted but commodity prices rose and farm
solvency still improved.</SUM>
