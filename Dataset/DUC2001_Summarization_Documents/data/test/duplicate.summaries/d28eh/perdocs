Temperatures in the mid-60s, 53% humidity, and wind wilted the 8,000
runners in the 12th Old Style/Chicago marathon on Sunday, which began
at Daley Plaza and wound through flat city streets. Organizers insist
this race is world-class with the world's richest purse, although it
lost its sponsor in 1986, staged no race in 1987, and no drug testing
is done. Paul Davies-Hale of England won in 2:11:25, the slowest
winning time since 1982.  It was his first marathon. Lisa Weidenbach
of Washington won among the women in 2:28:15. Each won $50,000. Second
place winners got $30,000 and third place $20,000.  Wheelchair races
are included.</SUM>

Sunday's America's Finest City HomeFed Half Marathon is scheduled to
begin at 7am at the Cabrillo Monument atop the Point Loma
Peninsula. It will wind to a finish line in Balboa Park. The course is
considered to be challenging and difficult. Most elite runners who
train in San Diego stay away from the race. Some competitors have run
in the Trib 10K in May, the Coronado Half Marathon in July, the
Goodwill Games 10K last month in Seattle, Grandma's Marathon, the New
York City Marathon, the Twin Cities Marathon, the San Francisco
Marathon, the Nebraska Half Marathon, and marathons in Houston and
Boston.</SUM>

While Lt. Guy Zanti's wife and father run the 26.2 miles of today's
Marine Corps Marathon in Washington, the naval officer intends to
match their efforts on the battleship Wisconsin where he is
stationed. The ship had been based in the Mediterranean, so he planned
on training on land and ship and then running the marathon on
land. When the Wisconsin was deployed to the gulf, Zanti continued his
training and plans to run on the ship. The Wisconsin is 887 feet long,
about one-sixth of a mile, so the 29-year old Zanti will have to make
about 75 laps.</SUM>

Foreigners continued their domination of the New York City
Marathon. Sunday's race was plagued by heat and humidity, with the
temperature reaching 72 and humidity peaking at 66%. The hottest year
in this race's history was 1984 when the temperature reached
79. Douglas Wakiihuri, a Kenyan who trains in Japan, won overall in
2:12:39.  Poland's Wanda Panfil, who lives in Mexico, was the women's
winner in 2:30:45. The last American men's winner was Alberto Salazar
in 1982. The last American women's champion was Miki Gorman in
1977. Wakiihuri also won the 1989 London Marathon and the 1990
Commonwealth Games marathon.</SUM>

13,000 runners expect to compete in the Boston Marathon on April
15th. The course is a jagged 26 miles and 385 yards from Hopkinton,
MA, to downtown Boston. Five miles into the race, a runner can waste
energy charging up a set of little hills. A steep descent into Newton
Lower Falls can jar runners' bones. After a long column of trees comes
Heartbreak Hill, and finally the Haunted Mile, a stretch where many
runners have collapsed. The race is covered by TV from start to finish
and offers a total of $402,000 in prize money. Winners get a medal and
$55,000.</SUM>

The last three Boston marathons have turned into reckless speed duels,
producing five of the top 10 times in the race's history and becoming
races of attrition. Last year all 11 checkpoint records were shattered
through the first 20 miles. The winner last year was Gelindo Bordin in
2:8:19. He ran a patient, calculating race and passed everyone at 21
miles. The historic route begins west of Boston in Hopkinton and ends
in Copley Square in Boston's Back Bay section. Competitors this year
have also run in the Olympics, the 1990 Commonwealth Games, and the
New York City and London marathons.</SUM>

The Long Beach Marathon Sunday had its largest-ever field with 4,021
entrants. Rex Wilson of New Zealand won in 2:12:27 and Wen Yanmin of
China won in 2:43:33, each setting course records and winning
$9,500. Robert Molinatti of Huntington Beach won the wheelchair
division in 1:47:59. The Pacific Rim Marathon, of teams from invited
countries, was run within the marathon.  The men's and women's winners
shrewdly waited for others to make mistakes and the sun to take its
toll. Wilson wanted to run at a 5-minute pace so was forced to take
the lead at ten miles. He commented that he hated marathons.</SUM>
