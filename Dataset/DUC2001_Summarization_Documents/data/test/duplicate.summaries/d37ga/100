A study of selected news articles 1988-1994 shows how frequently
assassination is part of the political picture around the world. The
struggle for national power in South Korea and the Philippines
resulted in one faction's attempt to eliminate its competition. In the
Middle East and North Africa the animosity between Moslem and Jew and
between moderate and extremist Islamic factions was expressed in
murder and terrorism. Minority religious and ethnic groups in India
killed their country's most competent leaders in the name of
separatism.  And in Latin America countries on the threshold of
choosing national leadership saw one candidate after another
eliminated by gun rather than by election.</SUM>
