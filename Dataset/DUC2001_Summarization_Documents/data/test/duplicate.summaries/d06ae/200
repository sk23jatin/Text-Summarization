The nation's police forces were in trouble in the late 1980s-early
1990s with charges of racism, brutality, and false arrest leveled
against them.

Typical was the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) that had to
suffer through a false arrest charge when one of its officers arrested
a retired major league baseball star; also when it had to endure the
disgrace of the Rodney King beating.  Investigations followed, and
much blame was put on its chief, Daryl Gates.

The LAPD did not do any better in handling anti-abortion
demonstrators.  They began twisting arms, etc.  One police chief
attributed the cause in part to a police chiefs' code of silence
concerning police abuse.

Even the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department succumbed to police
violence with shootings and even a robbery.

In other cities, the Long Beach Police was involved in a sting
operation when one of its officers was caught on videotape pushing an
undercover black policeman through a plate glass window.

Police forces in Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City Missouri, and Santa
Clara were also involved in cases of racism and brutality against
minorities.

To make matters worse, the Ventura County district attorney's office
refused to prosecute suspects who claimed police brutality.</SUM>
