The nation's police forces were in great difficulty in the late
1980s-early 1990s with charges of racism, brutality and false arrest
leveled against them.

The Los Angeles Police Department was prominent in these charges,
having to endure such publicized events as the videotaped Rodney King
beating.  There were investigations and on several occasions, police
chiefs were to blame, some even encouraging such police actions and
others remaining silent.

Police racism and brutality against minorities was prevalent.  One
county district attorney's office refused to prosecute suspects who
claimed police brutality, believing that it could not win such
cases.</SUM>
