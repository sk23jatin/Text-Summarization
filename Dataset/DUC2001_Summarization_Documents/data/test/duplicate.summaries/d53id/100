Shining Path guerrillas, who started their bloody uprising in the
mountains of Peru and claimed to be defenders of impoverished Peruvian
coca farmers, are becoming a political force that seeks public support
in the makeshift communities near the capital where two-thirds of
Lima's 7 million people live. The guerrillas demand that farmers pay
for protection from anti-drug police with one-fifth of their coca
crop.  They also banned drug abuse, prostitution, homosexuality and
thievery from the villages they control in Peru's Upper Huallaga River
Valley.  Though a number of top Shining Path leaders were arrested by
authorities, the Shining Path Central Committee, made up of members
who remain free, decided to continue the "people's war."</SUM>
