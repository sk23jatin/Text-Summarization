Shining Path guerrillas, who started their bloody uprising in the
mountains of Peru and claimed to be defenders of impoverished Peruvian
coca farmers, are becoming a political force that seeks public support
in the makeshift communities near the capital where two-thirds of
Lima's 7 million people live.  From their Andean base in the province
of Ayacucho, the guerrillas demand that farmers pay for protection
from anti-drug police with one-fifth of their coca crop.  They also
banned drug abuse, prostitution, homosexuality and thievery from the
villages they control in Peru's Upper Huallaga River Valley.

Though a number of top Shining Path leaders were arrested by
authorities, the Shining Path Central Committee, made up of members
who remain free, decided to continue the "people's war."  Jailed
leaders drew up their own peace proposal agreement with the
government, vowing to stop terrorism, selective murders, sabotage, and
armed agitation and propaganda.

When Alberto Fujimori took over as Peru's president, there was
speculation as to whether the Shining Path guerrilla movement would
hound his administration.</SUM>
