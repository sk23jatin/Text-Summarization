The subject of police brutality received national attention following
the airing of the videotaped beating of Rodney King by four Los
Angeles Policemen back in March.

A commission appointed by Mayor Tom Bradley and Police Chief Daryl
Gates in the wake of the videotaped beating was issued yesterday. The
commission found that a significant number of officers use excessive
force against Los Angeles residents.

In-mid June, a lawsuit against the Los Angeles Police Department was
settled when police agreed to stop using a martial-arts weapon,
nunchakus, against anti-abortion advocates.

Los Angeles is not the only city faced with claims of police
brutality. In Chicago, blacks accused officers of unprovoked beatings
and false arrests.

In Minneapolis, in January, allegations of police racism and brutality
shook the city following the deaths of two blacks at a drug raid that
went awry.

In Long Beach, California, a white policeman who was secretly filmed
while he pushed an off-duty black policeman through a plate-glass
window.

While in Kansas City, in June, several white officers bloodied a
Nigerian-born Roman Catholic priest with nightsticks as he lay on the
ground.

Finally, over the past two years, in Ventura County, California
district attorney's office dropped charges against four suspects who
contended that they were victims of police brutality.</SUM>
