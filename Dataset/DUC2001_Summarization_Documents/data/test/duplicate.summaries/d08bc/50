Total eclipses occur when the moon's shadow completely covers the
sun. They can occur in the same place once every 400 years, last up to
seven minutes, awe viewers and foster science.  The most impressive
eclipse between 1988 and 1991 was the 1991 eclipse that darkened
Hawaii, Mexico and Brazil.</SUM>
