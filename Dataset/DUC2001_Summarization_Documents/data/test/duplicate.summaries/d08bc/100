Total eclipses occur when the moon's shadow completely blocks out the
sun. Eclipses have been recorded as far back as 1200 years before
Christ. Total eclipses have a maximum duration of about seven minutes,
and a single location will experience an eclipse at roughly 400-year
intervals. Eclipses awe viewers and provide opportunities for
scientific discoveries.  A total eclipse occurred in 1988 over
Indonesia and the Philippines, and another in 1990 over Finland and
the Kola Peninsula. An eclipse in 1991 was noteworthy for its duration
and its visibility to large populations in Hawaii, Mexico and
Brazil.</SUM>
