The rate of tuberculosis, in decline for many years, rose again in the
early nineties, largely due to the prevalence of AIDS, which destroys
the body's ability to fight off the disease.

Inner cities were hard-hit, especially among black and Hispanic
populations which had a high rate of AIDS.

Health officials recommended vigorous testing and treatment programs.
TB, they said, is treatable and treatment was recommended, especially
in persons with AIDS.

Studies suggested that blacks are more susceptible to TB than whites.

TB, an airborne infection, was reportedly easily spread in poorly
ventilated office buildings, airplanes, hospitals and prisons.

Internationally, Latvia reported a sizable increase in TB.</SUM>
