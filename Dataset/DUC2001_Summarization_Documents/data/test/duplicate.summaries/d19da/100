From February 1988 until October 1989 there was debate in the
U.S. Senate and House over whether to include illegal aliens in the
1990 census count that would be used for reapportionment of
Congressional seats. States with large numbers of illegal aliens
tended to favor inclusion while those with few favored
exclusion. Twice the Senate approved amendments to major bills that
would exclude the illegal aliens and twice the House refused to go
along with the Senate vote. The matter was finally referred to
House-Senate Conference where on October 19, 1989 the negotiators
agreed to include illegal aliens in the count.</SUM>
