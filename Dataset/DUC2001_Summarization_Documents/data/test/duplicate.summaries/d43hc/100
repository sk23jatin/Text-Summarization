De Beers is a century-old South African company that produces and
markets gem quality diamonds. The company's marketing arm, the
London-based Central Selling Organization, controls the selling of 80
percent of the world's gem quality diamonds by cleverly manipulating
their supply and demand. Uncut diamonds from Namibia, Botswana,
Zimbabwe, Angola, Australia, Zaire and the Soviet Union are sold to
dealers concentrated in Antwerp., New York, Tel Aviv and Bombay. In
recent years the countries selling through the CSO have aggressively
sought more independence in selling their diamonds, but De Beers has
successfully deflected those efforts.
