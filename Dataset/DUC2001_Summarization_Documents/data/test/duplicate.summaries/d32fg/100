On 24 March 1989, the oil tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground on a reef
near Valdez, Alaska, spilling 8.4 million gallons of crude oil into
Prince William Sound.  In two days, the oil spread over 100 miles with
a heavy toll on wildlife.  Cleanup proceeded at a slow pace, and a
plan for cleaning 364 miles of Alaskan coastline was released.  In
June, the tanker was refloated.  By early 1990, only 5 to 9 percent of
spilled oil was recovered.  A federal jury indicted Exxon on five
criminal charges and the Valdez skipper was guilty of negligent
discharge of oil.</SUM>
