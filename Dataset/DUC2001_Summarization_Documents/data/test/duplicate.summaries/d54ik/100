In the early 1990s, an argument on the merits of term limits arose
nationwide.  Several states put the issue to referendum and the
question also emerged at the national level.

A CBS-Gallup Poll showed that Americans favored term limits regardless
of age, gender, party or ideology.

Proponents of limits cited the high rate of incumbent reelection,
creating life-long legislators who became arrogant and unresponsive to
constituents' issues.  Another result mentioned was a dearth of
minorities in legislatures and Congress.

Opponents cited the loss of experience and control over special
interest and lobbying groups and the weakening of legislative power,
among other issues.</SUM>
