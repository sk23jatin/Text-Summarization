A solar eclipse is caused by the moon obscuring the sun when the
moon's orbit crosses the sun's path twice each year. A third of these
crossings result in total eclipses.  Many ancient people were struck
with fear during an eclipse, but in modern times they are prime
viewing events.  The "eclipse of the century" in 1991, drew huge
crowds to Hawaii and even more to the Baja area of Mexico where the
eclipse was most pronounced.  Large throngs also viewed earlier
eclipses in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Finland.  Scientists and
the media caution against looking directly at the sun.</SUM>
