The occurrences of tuberculosis increased in the 1980s after a three
decade decline.  By 1990 it was the world's deadliest infectious
disease, killing three million annually.  The tuberculosis was fueled
by AIDS patients who were vulnerable when their lowered immune system
allowed the latent bacteria to develop into active tuberculosis. They
then transmitted it to others. Tuberculosis ran rampant in sub-Saharan
Africa, and increased in Latin America and Southeast Asia. In the
United States the highest rates of infection were in the
Northeast. Prisoners are highly susceptible to the disease. Airtight
buildings with bad ventilation spawns tuberculosis.</SUM>
