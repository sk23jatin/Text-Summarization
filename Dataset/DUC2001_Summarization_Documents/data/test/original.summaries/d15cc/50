Tuberculosis increased rapidly during the 1980s and by 1990 was the
world's deadliest infectious disease. AIDS sufferers, with their
damaged immune systems, developed tuberculosis in great numbers and
transmitted it to others. Tuberculosis was especially prevalent in
poorer countries. In the United States, it was most often seen in the
northeastern states.</SUM>
