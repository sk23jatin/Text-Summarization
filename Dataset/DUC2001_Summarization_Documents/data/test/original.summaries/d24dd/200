Actress Elizabeth Taylor, 58 was admitted to Daniel Freeman Marina
Hospital on April 8 with a sinus infection and was transferred to
St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica on April 16 because of a
persistent fever and viral pneumonia.
 
She later underwent a biopsy that showed that Miss Taylor was
suffering from bacterial pneumonia and a yeast infection.

During a news conference, doctors revealed that Miss Taylor was near
death on April 22.  She also suffered a nearly fatal bout with
pneumonia in 1961 and underwent a tracheotomy to help her breathe.

Taylor has been plagued with health problems for years, particularly
recurring back troubles that began with a fall from a horse when she
was 13.

In 1983, she acknowledged a 35-year addiction to sleeping pills and
painkillers.  Miss Taylor has been treated for alcohol and drug abuse
at the Betty Ford Clinic.

Visitors throughout Miss Taylor's hospitalization included her four
children, Maria Burton-Carson, Liza Todd-Tivey and Christopher and
Michael Wilding.

During Miss Taylor's stay at St. John's hospital, the tabloids had
been humming with rumors that Liz Taylor had AIDS. Following her
recovery, Miss Taylor filed a $20 lawsuit against The National
Enquirer that was settled out of court for an undetermined
amount.</SUM>
