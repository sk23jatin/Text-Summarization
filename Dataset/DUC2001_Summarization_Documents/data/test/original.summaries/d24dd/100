Actress Elizabeth Taylor, 58 was admitted to Daniel Freeman Marina
Hospital on April 8 with a sinus infection and was transferred to
St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica on April 16 because of a
persistent fever and viral pneumonia.
 
She later underwent a biopsy that showed that Miss Taylor was
suffering from bacterial pneumonia and a yeast infection that almost
resulted in her death.

Miss Taylor suffered a nearly fatal bout with pneumonia in 1961 and
underwent a tracheotomy to help her breathe.

Visitors throughout Miss Taylor's hospitalization included her four
children, Maria Burton-Carson, Liza Todd-Tivery and Christopher and
Michael Wilding.</SUM>
