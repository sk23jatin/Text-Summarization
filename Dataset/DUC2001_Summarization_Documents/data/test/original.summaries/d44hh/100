Labor and grassroots groups argued NAFTA would send US jobs south and
harm the environment. Hispanic civil rights groups feared US Hispanic
workers would suffer.  Business spent millions to support NAFTA,
believing superior US productivity and products would
benefit. Rejection would increase protectionism and inflation and slow
economic growth. President Clinton made environmental and labor side
agreements, including a North American Development Bank to assist
NAFTA-damaged communities, and promised undecideds new projects in
their districts. A debate victory by VP Gore over Ross Perot helped
swing public opinion. After NAFTA's approval in November 1993, Central
American and Caribbean governments awaited promised Caribbean-basin
market protections.</SUM>
