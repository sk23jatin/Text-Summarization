Tornadoes, most prevalent in April through June, are generally found
in the south and the nation's heartland states, but can occur
elsewhere.  Tornadoes, on average, are about 25 yards wide and travel
about two miles on the ground at a speed of 30 mph.  Violent
tornadoes, with wind speeds more than 200 mph and a path averaging 26
miles, will cut a swath of death and destruction as experienced in
Huntsville, Alabama in November 1989.  Meteorologists attribute the
decline in tornado-related deaths to greater public awareness, such as
knowing the difference between a tornado "watch" and "warning" and
taking proper shelter.</SUM>
