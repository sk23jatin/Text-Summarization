In 1988, at least 29% of the nation was hit by a drought about equal
to the one in 1911.  In August 1988, Reagan signed a $3.9 billion
drought relief bill.  Grain production was predicted to be 31% below
1987.  The aid package did reduce loses and stave off bankruptcies in
the drought ravaged states, but much of the money ended up in other
hands.

A 1990 postmortem of the drought revealed that it was not as bad as it
could have been.  Computer modeling suggested it was caused by ocean
temperature abnormalities near the equator in the Pacific Ocean.</SUM>
