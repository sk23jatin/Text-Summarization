The World Bank has not been successful in reducing Third World debt.

There are many differing views on how to accomplish this, from
adhering to the bank's policies to writing off these debts as
uncollectible.

A persistent problem in loaning money by the World Bank is that Third
World countries are often overwhelmed with interest payments.

World Bank officials will not make a commitment on specific measures
for Third World debt reduction.

Some individual initiatives for alleviating Third World debt and
poverty are promising in that they are directed at human resources and
are not commercial arrangements.</SUM>
