Between June 1988 and October 1990 United States military aircraft
were involved in accidents in several parts of the world and in
varying circumstances.  Reports on certain crashes show that several
categories of aircraft were involved; fighters, helicopters, attack
planes, a bomber, a transport, and a trainer.  There were crashes in
the United States, Britain, Japan, Germany and Saudi Arabia, and over
the oceans and aboard a carrier.

The United States was at peace, and no aircraft loss was caused by the
actions of another power.  During the latter part of the period,
however, several crashes occurred at a time when the United States was
building up its forces preparatory to combat action.

The Marines lost two UH-1 Huey helicopters.  The Navy lost two F-14
fighters and a T- 2 Buckeye trainer.

The Air Force lost three F-16 fighters, two A-10 attack aircraft, an
F-111 fighter- bomber, an F-4 reconnaissance jet, a B-52 bomber, and a
C-5 transport. It was the crash of the huge transport that caused the
greatest loss of life, but it was the crash of one of the A- 10s that
raised the greatest concerns because it destroyed considerable German
property and killed seven German civilians.</SUM>
