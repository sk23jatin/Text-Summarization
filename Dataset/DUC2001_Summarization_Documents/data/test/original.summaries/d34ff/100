Hurricanes are spanned in the Atlantic off the coast of Africa.
Average or heavy rains in the Sahel result in more, and more intense,
hurricanes and dry seasons lead to fewer hurricanes according to
Dr. William Gray a Colorado meteorologist.  Since accurate records
have been kept, three category five hurricanes have hit the Atlantic
or Gulf coasts and caused great loss of life and billions of dollars
of damages.  In 1900, the Galveston hurricane killed 6,000.  More and
better satellites will improve hurricane tracking.  However, the
potential for loss of life and extensive damages are higher because of
increased population and construction in coastal areas.</SUM>
