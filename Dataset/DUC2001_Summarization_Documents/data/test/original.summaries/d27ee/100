The Second Amendment concerns the right to "--keep and bear arms." The
interpretation of this amendment determines the success or lack of
success of effective gun control legislation.

The National Rifle Association (NRA) leads the pro-gun lobby. The NRA
interprets the Second Amendment as guaranteeing the right of the
individual "--to keep and bear arms."

Gun control advocates interpret the Second Amendment in the light of
its 1792 context, i.e., it is neither a legal basis for gun ownership
nor for non- registration.

Public opinion appears to be turning toward a more favorable view of
the need for gun control.</SUM>
