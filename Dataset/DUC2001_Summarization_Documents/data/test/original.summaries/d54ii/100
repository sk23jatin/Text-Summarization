In the early 1990's, term limitations for elected officials,
especially legislators, was a popular issue.  According to polls, 75%
of Americans backed limits.  It was hard to unseat an incumbent and
term limits were viewed as constitutional and a way to end political
careerism and take power away from special interest groups.  Others
believed amateurism would result and increase the power of the special
interest groups, unelected staffers, and executive department
bureaucrats.  Limits, not supported by the nation's founders, would
restrict the voter's choice and throw out the good officeholders with
the bad.  Some pundits suggested less radical solutions.</SUM>
