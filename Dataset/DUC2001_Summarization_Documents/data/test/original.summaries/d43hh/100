The De Beers cartel, controlled by the Oppenheimer family, controls
80% of the uncut diamond market through its Central Selling
Organization. The cartel has kept the diamond market stable by
maintaining a buffer pool of diamonds for matching supply to
demand. De Beers opened a new mine in 1992 and extended the life of
two others through underground mining.  Innovations have included
automated processing and bussing workers in daily from their
homes. African nations have recently demanded better terms. After the
Soviet breakup, De Beers contracted for diamonds with the Yukutian
Republic. The US remains the largest diamond market, followed by
Japan.</SUM>
