Clarence Thomas was born in rural Georgia. At age seven he came under
the care of his maternal grandparents. They taught him the merits of
self-reliance and hard work, values that fueled his conservatism. He
was educated at Holy Cross and Yale Law. He held a series of
government positions before serving eight years as Chairman of the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In 1990 President Bush
appointed him to a federal appellate court. A year later he was
nominated to succeed Thurgood Marshall on the Supreme Court. After
contentious hearings he was confirmed as an Associate Supreme Court
Judge.</SUM>
