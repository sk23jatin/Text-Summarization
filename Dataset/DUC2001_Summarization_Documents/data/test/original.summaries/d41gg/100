The 1988 fires in the greater Yellowstone ecosystem were the worst in
a hundred years, burning nearly 1.5 million acres.  The House
Agriculture Committee has planned hearings into how the Forest Service
handled the wildfires.  The Interior Department ordered a moratorium
on its "let- burn"'policy.  New studies showed unseen smoke hazards
faced by firefighters.

Firefighters battled hundreds of blazes in five Western states in
1989.  California was geared up for a dangerous wildfire season in
1991.  Residents in Santa Barbara were advised on fire- resistant
landscaping (e.g., firescaping and xeriscaping) and potential
firestorm problem areas around San Francisco Bay were
identified.</SUM>
