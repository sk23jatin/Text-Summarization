In 1988 economic decline was increasing Slovenian-Serbian friction. In
June 1990 a new government in Slovenia planned for Slovenian
sovereignty within a Yugoslav confederation. In June 1991 fighting
followed Serbian president Milosevic's blocking of a Croatian federal
president, and an EC-brokered cease-fire called for a three-month
delay in independence moves. More fighting followed Slovenia's June
25th secession.  Slovenia sought to become a market-oriented
