Efforts of the British government to wipe out "mad cow disease" proved
unsuccessful during the period 1986-1994. A ban on use of sheep offal
in cattle feed and extensive destruction of infected cattle (120,00 by
1994) seemed to have little effect.  The similarity of the disease to
a rarely seen fatal human ailment (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) led to
the fear that humans might be infected by cattle or by eating
beef. Scientists discounted this fear but more research was needed to
dispel it. Germany began conducting such research while at the same
time discussing a ban on import of British beef.</SUM>
