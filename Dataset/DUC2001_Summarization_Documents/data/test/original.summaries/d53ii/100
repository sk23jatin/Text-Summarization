The Shining Path is a Peruvian Maoist group founded in 1970 by Abimael
Guzman.  This group sought to overthrow Peru's elected government and
install a peasant and worker state.  For 10 years is worked among the
Indians in the Andes, then began guerrilla operations eventually
moving into the jungles and cities.  Until Fujimori was elected
president in 1990, Peruvian presidents had not been successful in
handling the Shining Path, but, by 1994, many leaders of the group,
including Guzman, were in jail.  A faction of free guerrillas also had
formed and was beginning to assert power repudiating Guzman and his
negotiations with the government.</SUM>
