The most important of the many cases of police brutality reported in
southern California 1989-1992, was the beating of Rodney King by four
Los Angeles officers on March 3, 1991. An investigating commission
outlined steps for improvement of the police department and called for
the resignation of Chief Gates. Gates did not resign until the
following year after the acquittal of the four officers caused massive
rioting. Other cases of police brutality arose in Minneapolis, Chicago
and Kansas City. Operation Rescue claimed that its non-violent
anti-abortion demonstrators were seriously injured by excessive police
tactics in more than 50 cities.</SUM>
