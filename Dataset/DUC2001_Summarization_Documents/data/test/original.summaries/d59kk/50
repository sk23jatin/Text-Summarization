A number of domestic and foreign planes crashed during the years
1987-1991.  Some of the suspected causes are mechanical failure, pilot
error, extreme weather and terrorist activity.

Occasionally causes overlap, such as pilot error during a mechanical
crisis, or navigational problems in bad weather.  Some crashes remain
a mystery.</SUM>
