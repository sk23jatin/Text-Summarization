A survey of plane crashes during the years from 1987-1991 reveals that
probable causes include mechanical failure, severe weather, terrorist
actions and pilot error, and occasionally a combination of factors.

Two crashes were almost certainly caused by mechanical problems.  A
United Airlines DC-10 experienced a total hydraulic failure - a very
rare occurrence - after an explosion and fire in one engine caused
metal shards to fly into the tail assembly.  In the other, a passenger
plane crashed on takeoff after an engine failed.  And in Britain, a
Boeing 737 experienced an engine fire, then the wrong engine was shut
down.  The plane crash-landed with the loss of 42 passengers.

In two crashes, the planes first exploded in mid-air.  At the time of
the reports, terrorist bombs were suspected; both countries involved
had been warned beforehand, and credit was claimed by terrorists
afterward.

A deadly wind shear apparently caused a jetliner to plunge to earth in
Colorado, and, weather also may have played a role when a two-engine
plane hit a mountain peak in Ethiopia and disintegrated.

Two small plane crashes were included.  One took place in poor
weather, and the other remains a mystery to date.</SUM>
