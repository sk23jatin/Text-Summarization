President Reagan made welfare reform a priority for his
administration.  He believed that work must be the focus of any
welfare reform program and vowed to veto any reform legislation that
Congress passed that did not contain a work requirement.

The goal of welfare reform should be: to shrink the welfare system, to
eliminate perverse incentives to remain on welfare, and to make work
the focus of reform.  Controversy occurs when deciding how this can be
accomplished.  Some conservatives believe that welfare should be
limited to a strict time period, say, two years.  Other people prefer
a phased-in program whereby welfare recipients must do something to
earn continued benefits, such as work, vocational training or
continuing education.

President Clinton also pledged to "end welfare as we know it."  He
made The Family Support Act of 1988 the basis of his reform efforts.
The Clinton administration also granted individual states waivers from
federal welfare requirements in order to experiment with various
reform programs.  Several states did so quite successfully.

Welfare reform is not just an American problem.  The 24 member nations
of the European "Organization for Economic Co-operation" have
concluded that their rapidly growing welfare costs my soon become
insupportable.</SUM>
