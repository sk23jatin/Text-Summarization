Welfare reform has received government emphasis from the Reagan
administration through the Clinton administration.  Believing that
huge welfare expenditures had been mostly unsuccessful, a consensus
finally formed that welfare should be short-term help for the needy,
not a way of life, and the goal of reform must be to place welfare
recipients into the workforce.  This is being accomplished through
successful federal and state programs that place time limits on
receiving welfare and require recipients to earn benefits through work
or study.  The 24 European member nations of the Organization for
Economic Co-operation are also struggling with their welfare
problems.</SUM>
