Exxon Valdez, a large oil tanker, ran aground in Alaskan waters on 24
March 1989, creating the largest oil spill in US history.  The vessel
was illegally piloted by a mate and the captain, Joseph Hazelwood, was
drunk at the time.  Later, Hazelwood was found guilty of negligence.
The spill spread to an area the size of Delaware and taxed efforts at
clean up.  Thousands of birds and sea animals were killed by the
spill.  A year later, the area was judged still to be unable to cope
with a 10M gallon spill.  Cost of the clean up to Exxon was over $2B
in 1989.</SUM>
