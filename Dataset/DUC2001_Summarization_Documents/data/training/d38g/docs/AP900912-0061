   A 66-year-old physician, a botanist and a
marine biologist were among four men and four women picked today to
spend two years inside a 2\-acre sealed dome intended to be a
microcosm of Earth.
   The eight from the United States, West Germany, England and
Belgium will be the crew of the giant terrarium known as Biosphere
II. The privately financed $30 million project aims for a December
start.
   Biosphere II will resemble a space colony tethered to Earth. It
will be a laboratory for solving environmental problems on
Biosphere I _ the Earth _ as well as a prototype for sustaining
life outside this world.
   The crew, all single, consists of:
   _ Dr. Roy Walford, 66, the oldest crew member and only
physician, a research gerontologist, nutritionist and professor of
pathology at the UCLA School of Medicine, and the project's medical
chief and biomedical consultant.
   _ Linda Leigh, 38, a botanist who directed and coordinated the
project's ecosystem planning for land areas, or biomes, directed
the collection and acquisition of more than 2,000 plant species and
spent three weeks last fall inside a completely closed test module.
   _ Bernd Zabel, 41, an electrical engineer from Munich, West
Germany, who served as construction general manager for the project.
   _ Sally Silverstone, 35, a native of Walthamstow, England, who
has administered the Space Biospheres Ventures' architectural
division.
   _ Abigail K. Alling, 31, a marine biologist from Maine with
degrees from Middlebury College and Yale University who has
directed the Biosphere's marine ecological systems.
   _ Taber Kyle MacCallum, 26, of Albuquerque, N.M., in charge of
the Biosphere's analytical laboratory.
   _ Jane Elizabeth Poynter, 28, a native of Surrey, England, who
has been manager of the intensive agriculture system.
   _ Mark Van Thillo, of Wilrijk-Antwerp, Belgium, who has been in
charge of construction quality control.
   Two others who had been finalists included Norberto
Alvarez-Romo, 37, of Guadalajara, Mexico, and Silke Schneider, 31,
a West German.
   For two years, the crew's world inside the geodesic frame of
glass and steel will consist of seven ecological regions: rain
forest, savannah, ocean, fresh and saltwater marshes, desert,
agriculture and human habitat. The latter includes apartments and
laboratory, office and recreational facilities.
   Sprinkled into the ecological stew will be 3,800 plant and
animal species. All air, water and food will be generated
independently of the Earth's atmosphere and will be recycled, as
will all wastes.
   The only link between the dome's ecological system and Earth
will be electrical power transmissions, as well as computers and
telecommunications.
   The experiment, a stepchild of Texas financier Edward P. Bass,
could become a money-producing venture, particularly as a means of
showing ways of responding to environmental problems such as
pollution, scientists have said.
