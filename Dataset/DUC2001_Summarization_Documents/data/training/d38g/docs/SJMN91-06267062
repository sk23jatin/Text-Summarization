<TEXT>     Welcome to Biosphere 2 -- a domed Garden of Eden in the foothills of the
Santa Catalina mountains outside Tucson. Here, beginning on Thursday, four men
and four women will confine themselves for two years in one of the most
bizarre research escapades in modern times.;   Is it science or schlock? A
tour de force or a tourist trap?;   A year behind schedule and five years in
the making, Biosphere 2 has forged ahead despite questions about its
credibility, charges of cultism and accusations that leaders bullied departed
consultants.;   The creation of billionaire oil mogul Edward Bass, Biosphere 2
aims to study how people can live in an airtight world. In this biological
maze, plants will recycle human wastes and turn them into the sustenance of
life -- air, food and water.;   Biosphere 2 could be the first step in the
construction of a massive way station in space, its developers hope, and at
the very least could help improve life on Earth.;   But as the "Biospherians"
prepare to don their spiffy blue jump suits and kiss the outside world
goodbye, Earthlings are watching with a mixture of awe, fascination and
skepticism.;   Supporters gush that the grand experiment rivals the moon
landing. Detractors snicker that Biosphere 2 could be the greatest stunt since
"War of the Worlds.";   "I don't know what they are attempting to do," said
Robert D. MacElroy, a scientist at NASA/Ames Research Center at Moffett Field,
where plans for a small space cottage are in their infancy.;   MacElroy has
visited the Biosphere 2 project and said, "There's a pretty grotesque size
differential to what we're involved in. I don't know . . . how it would help
with what we're doing.";   'NASA could never do this'; "NASA could never do
this," countered Robert Frye, a project consultant and ecologist at the
University of Arizona's Environmental Research Laboratory. "NASA would have
spent a hundred million dollars and come up with a roomful of reports. But
Biosphere 2 has a structure that can be used and studied for 100 years.";  
Looking like Hollywood's "Battlestar Gallactica," the gleaming steel-and-glass
shell of Biosphere 2 is as long as three football fields and as tall as a
five-story building. Inside are parts of a South American rain forest, a
Caribbean coral reef and ocean, a Florida freshwater swamp, a Baja desert and
a tropical Australian savannah. They are inhabited by 3,800 transplanted
species of birds, reptiles, plants and insects.;   The eight Biospherians, all
single, will electronically monitor their world through a maze of computers in
the glitzy command center. A short walk will take them from the shore of an
ocean to the mountains of a rain forest to barren desert. They will live in
modern loft apartments and be under the constant watch of Biosphere 1 -- the
Earth -- from a "Mission Control" located across the street.;   The mood
inside Biosphere 2 was upbeat last week as participants counted down the days
until Thursday's "closure," when air locks will be shut and the crew sealed
inside. They seemed unperturbed by continuing questions from reporters about
the project's credibility.;   News reports since 1985 have linked the
project's leaders to a 1970s commune where, some ex-commune members say,
Biosphere 2 executive John Allen led a cult devoted to creating a new
civilization. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported that one of Allen's
protege's was oilman Bass, Biosphere 2's main financier.;   Leader was a
'tyrant';   Laurence Veysey, a retired history professor from the University
of California, Santa Cruz, who studied the commune in 1971, remembers Allen as
a tyrant given to rages. Veysey recalls seeing "biosphere" written on a
dining-room wall of the New Mexico commune, Synergia Ranch.;   "They were a
very secretive group," said Veysey, who devoted 100 pages to the ranch in a
book on communes. "It was hard to figure out what they were up to.";   In the
years since the commune disbanded, Allen's vision and Bass's deep pockets have
funded ecological ventures from Katmandu to France to western Australia. One
was the Institute of Ecotechnics in London, billed by Biosphere 2 as "a
major-ecological think-tank." Several of Biosphere 2's leaders have
unaccredited degrees from the institute.;   Institute non-existent;   A
Canadian television documentary last year went looking for the institute and
found only an office over a cafe and art gallery.;   Allen and Bass could not
be reached for comment. In the past, Bass has denied being influenced by
Allen, who told the Arizona Daily Star in June that he never operated "any
mystical program.";   "The whole cult thing is ridiculous," said Kathleen
Dyhr, spokeswoman for Biosphere 2. "There have been so many people with
Biosphere 2 who never had anything to do with John Allen 20 years ago.";  
During construction, Biosphere 2 recruited outside consultants from such
reputable institutions as Yale University and the Smithsonian, Dyhr said. And
many of the ecological studies here have been lauded by the scientific
community, she said.;   Project has defectors;   But at least a half-dozen
respected researchers have left the project, citing differences of substance
and style. Some later recanted their criticisms, saying they were warned by
Biosphere representatives they could be sued for libel.;   Even now, many
mainstream scientists wonder what Biosphere 2 will accomplish.;   Its makers
contend they have made an ecological system "out of nothing." But the
structure will be powered by a set of natural gas generators and maintained by
a staff of 50 outside support people.;   Some scientists also wonder whether
Biosphere 2 will be leakproof. How will it hold up under the elements? And if
they survive two years, what will Biospherians learn, other than how to live
in a gigantic terrarium?;   Naivety suggested; "I think they went into this
rather naively," said Frank Salisbury, a plant physiologist at Utah State
University. "I hope something good comes out of this, but I'm skeptical.";  
Biosphere 2 officials counter that something good already has, and point to 50
design patents in the works.;   First and foremost, they say, Biosphere 2 is a
business. It's already the state's second largest tourist attraction after the
Grand Canyon, and promoters are banking that more than a million people a year
will visit.;   In fact, in the first five months of 1991, 65,000 people came
to see the project, a hundredfold increase over the same period in 1990.;  
Shown a movie and taken on a walking tour for $9.95, visitors mostly gush over
the landscape and rarely ask probing questions. They crowd the gift shop
buying up Biosphere 2 memorabilia.;   "It's really turning out to be nothing
more than a tourist attraction," said Yvonne Clearwater, an environmental
psychologist at NASA/Ames who sees little scientific value to Biosphere 2.;  
"It's kind of like a kooky Disneyland."  </TEXT>
