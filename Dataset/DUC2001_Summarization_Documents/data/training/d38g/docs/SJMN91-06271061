<LEADPARA>  After years of preparation, four men and four women Thursday shut the door on
the world they hope to aid and began two years of ecological research in
Biosphere 2, an airtight, three-acre structure of glass and steel that has
stirred controversy as well as awe.;   "Biospherians, good friends, bon
voyage!" exclaimed Ed Bass, the Fort Worth millionaire who bankrolled much of
the ambitious $150 million project that some see as a New Age sequel to Noah's
ark. "And fly your spaceship well that all of humankind might fly its
spaceship Earth better in the future."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Biospherian Abigail Alling, 32, a Yale-educated marine biologist, broke
down during the emotional send-off but recovered her composure as she and Dr.
Roy Walford followed the six others into the sprawling terrarium.;   After two
tries, the main passage to the outside slammed shut Thursday morning.;   At
midmorning, after a half-hour getting accustomed to their new situation, the
eight told project officials that each was about to begin work in his or her
respective "biome," or ecosystem. The Biosphere has a growing area as well as
wilderness rain forest, marsh, mini-ocean, African savanna and desert.;   What
the Biosphere residents find out over the next 24 months, proponents say, will
help to understand the workings of nature and the possibilities of living in
artificial atmospheres in outer space.;   They will recycle their air, water
and waste, and live off a half-acre of land and from plants grown in tanks of
water infused with nutrients. If french fries are on the menu, peanuts would
have to be uprooted and pressed for cooking oil and spuds harvested and
peeled.;   The eight researchers are all single, and there is no prohibition
against sex. This has led to more than a little speculation in nearby Oracle,
a 111-year-old community of 6,000, many of them copper miners and retirees.;  
"I told Laser (the nickname for Biospherian Mark Van Thillo), 'You're in there
two years and I'll bet you $5 you'll come out with two kids,' " said Larry
Springfield, 45, a locksmith on the project and manager of Maria's, an Oracle
saloon. "He said, 'Four.' "  </TEXT>
