<LEADPARA>  Dressed like space travelers from "Star Trek," eight smiling "biospherians"
were locked this morning into a sealed terrarium where they plan to stay until
1993 while trying to replicate the Earth's environment.;   The ceremonial
"closure" was not without the histrionics that have marked the bizarre
Biosphere 2 project -- described alternatively as a modern-day Noah's Ark and
a scientific sham.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Billionaire oil executive Edward Bass, who bankrolled much of the $150
million project, invoked the visions of Galileo, Leonardo da Vinci and the
Wright brothers. One crew member gushed about a future when humans will become
"custodians of our world.";   "Today we gather at a new instrument . . . to
explore the mysteries of our very own home planet," Bass said, as the crew
members, wearing futuristic black uniforms, fought to contain their emotions.;
  Crew member Abigail Alling, 31, her voice quavering, evoked the sometimes
mystical bent of Biosphere 2's organizers: "By necessity, we biospherians walk
in as custodians of our world and bring past and future together.";   At 8:18
a.m., the four men and four women of the crew exchanged quick hugs and kisses
with relatives and project officials, stepped through an air-lock door, waved
through the round window, and disappeared inside the 3.15-acre geodesic-framed
compound.;   "I have had a vision that man could change from being a
desert-maker into a builder of oases," crew member Mark Nelson said before
stepping through the air lock.;   Biosphere 2 consists of several climatic
zones -- rain forest, savanna, ocean and marsh -- packed with 3,800 plant and
animal species. It's all part of a test of space-colonization technology with
the dream of someday locating such a complex on Mars.;   The ultra-modern
complex includes such luxury items as computers, facsimile machines,
telephones, televisions, videocassette recorders and exercise equipment. The
communications apparatus will tie the crew into a control center located a few
hundred yards away, and to the rest of the world.;   Critics say the project
has little scientific merit. It has forged ahead despite doubts over its
authenticity, charges of cultism and the loss of several of its prominent
consultants.;   "The guise of science has fallen over time," said Yvonne
Clearwater, an environmental psychologist at the NASA Ames Research Center at
Moffett Field. "It's really turning out to be a tourist attraction.";   Space
Biospheres Ventures, developer of the private, for-profit project, expects to
draw up to a million visitors annually and has applied for some 50 design
patents.;   "Fundamentally, we are a business," Bass said. "Our first name
'Space' draws upon the most dramatic applications for the technologies we are
developing.";   The crew members, ranging in age from 27 to 67, will raise
their own food and recycle all air, water and wastes. Wednesday they
celebrated a final day of freedom with diversity by attending an ecological
seminar, a laser show, a cocktail party and a press conference.;   The
45-minute closing ceremony after dawn today included prayers from a Tibetan
monk and a sun dance by Dan Old Elk, a Sioux from Montana who presented each
crew member with a braided sprig of sweet grass from Canada.;   Alling, a
native of New York, said before the experiment began that she expects life
inside Biosphere 2 to be "much like a ship setting sail for the open sea.";  
"You're out there, and whatever you have on board and whoever is with you on
board is who you've got, and you've got to make it through whatever comes up,"
she said.;   The four-man, four-woman group has two people from England, one
from Belgium and five from the United States.;   Each crew member is likely to
spend about four hours daily on farming and other chores to maintain the
complicated machinery driving the Biosphere. Another four hours a day will go
to scientific work.;   Sex has not been ruled out among the crew members, but
none of the four women plans a pregnancy.;   Mark van Thillo, 30, of Belgium
said he would miss his country's chocolates, while Taber McCallum, 27, of
Albuquerque, N.M., said he'll regret not "sailing on the open ocean and the
open sky.";   The crew is hoping to stay inside for two years, barring serious
illness or other calamity.;   But Margret Augustine, president and chief
executive officer of the project, said problems could crop up after a month or
so that would require the crew to leave temporarily before returning for a
solid two years. And a person could leave if he or she suffered from extreme
psychological pressure, she said.;   'It's not a prison," she said.  </TEXT>
