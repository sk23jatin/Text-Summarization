   Botanist Linda Leigh, who has spent the
last three weeks literally in her element, called her stay in an
experimental biosphere a success Wednesday but said she's ready to
return to Earth.
   When Ms. Leigh exits Thanksgiving afternoon from 21 days inside
an airtight, 17,000-cubic foot glass-and-steel structure, she will
have been the longest inhabitant of a completely enclosed
ecosystem, with air and water generated and recycled independently
of Earth's.
   ``I'll be emerging tomorrow at 2 p.m. as scheduled, and
everything is rolling,'' she said.
   Ms. Leigh has been living inside a test module for Biosphere II,
a $30 million project under construction. Scientists plan to place
four men and four women inside a much larger sealed structure for
two years to determine whether humans can duplicate Earth's life
systems for possible use in space.
   ``The one thing that I really do miss is just companionship,''
Ms. Leigh said Wednesday in a telephone interview from within the
module, located on a ranch about 30 miles north of Tucson.
   ``I don't think that it's a matter of feeling lonely, but
there's just something about direct human contact and sitting with
somebody and pouring them a cup of tea or a cup of coffee and
having that morning discussion; it's very different than doing it
over the phone or over the video,'' she said.
   ``Other than that, I'm quite content on the inside. I feel like
I could stay in here indefinitely.''
   Since entering the module Nov. 2, Ms. Leigh has been in frequent
daily contact with her outside support team by telephone, video
conference, two-way radio and just looking through the glass
windows.
   Three daily medical checks, including pulse at rest and after
exercise, blood pressure, pulmonary function, blood oxygen
saturation and urine tests, have shown her health is ``unbelievably
positive. The physicians on the outside can't believe it,'' she
said.
   Two people also check her psychologically each day, Ms. Leigh
said, ``just to make sure that my state of mind or humor is
normal.''
   Ms. Leigh baked herself a 39th birthday cake on Nov. 12 of
sorghum, rice flour and sweet potatoes harvested from her
mini-field. Her colleagues serenaded her with ``Happy Birthday'' by
video and directed her to gifts hidden in her living area.
   Other crops have ranged from jalapeno peppers to kohlrabi. Lemon
grass, mint, tarragon and fennel are among the herbs she has used
to season her meals and make tea. She also has a tank of talapia
fish.
   ``I had talapia Vera Cruzana the other night,'' she said.
   Water for drinking, cooking and showering is dehumidified from
the air. Samples are passed through a special port for outside
analysis, along with samples of waste water and her urine. The rest
of the waste water is fed into a marsh recycling system.
   The botanist also has had to be a mechanic and technician,
repairing the loose belt of a large fan that heats and cools the
module, and fine-tuning the irrigation system.
   Ms. Leigh said she hasn't felt isolated because her support team
is excellent. In fact, she occasionally has had to pull the
curtains in her living area to get away from the observing eyes
outside. Either that, ``or I go out into what we call `the
wilderness' and just stay out within the plants.''
