<LEADPARA>  Critics have long contended that the Biosphere 2 project in the Arizona desert
has more to do with showmanship or cultism than science, despite its repeated
assertions to the contrary.;   Now, a newspaper says the $150 million effort
is not the environmental experiment it claims to be.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The project began with much fanfare in September when four men and four
women, accompanied by 3,000 species of plants and animals, sealed themselves
inside a eight-story glass structure for a two-year experiment in biological
recycling.;   The allegations of misrepresentation involve a device that
removes carbon dioxide from the air and turns it into a solid for storage
inside the Biosphere.;   Carbon dioxide is exhaled by humans and metabolized
by plants.;   The current issue of the Village Voice says the group secretly
installed the device, violating the advertised goal of recycling all materials
naturally.;   The Voice also said the levels of carbon dioxide in Biosphere 2
were becoming dangerously high, apparently because of the decrease in sunlight
and the resulting decline in photosynthetic activity by the plants.;  
Kathleen Dyhr, a Biosphere spokeswoman, said in a telephone interview that the
group had indeed installed a carbon dioxide remover.;   She conceded that it
was not "natural" but called it a minor aid to help stabilize the atmosphere
during its initial fluctuations. The carbon dioxide levels were currently
fine, she added, though higher than outside the closed environment.;   Dyhr
said the privately financed project had no obligation to disclose all the
details of work in progress.;   "If the experiment were formally reported,
written up in a publication, and no mention was made of that fact, then that
would be fraud," she said. "But I don't know of any research project that
would discuss all its methods and techniques" this early in the process. "No
experiment would be giving out data to the press.";   From the start, when
planning for the Biosphere got under way in the mid-1980s, it was billed as a
futuristic experiment in closed recycling where plants and animals would
provide each other with all the essentials for life.;   Most especially, green
plants would take human wastes (urine, feces and carbon dioxide) and turn them
into oxygen, water and food for human consumption. No mention was made of
chemical aids to the process.  </TEXT>
