Eclipses of the sun or the moon draw attention and interest throughout
the world, arousing superstitions, and evoking religious services and
tourist packages.  A solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between
the Earth and the sun, blocking our ability to see the sun.  A lunar
eclipse occurs when the moon passes through the shadow created by the
Earth, blocking the sun's light.  The Chinese first recorded a total
solar eclipse in 2137 B.C.  Looking directly at a solar eclipse
without adequate protection can seriously damage the eyes, but
publicity has lessened injuries.

Two solar eclipses occurred in Asia in 1988.  On March 11, a total
eclipse was visible from the Indian Ocean across Indonesia and the
Philippines.  On September 11, a partial eclipse lasted for 90 minutes
over India.  A second partial eclipse was visible across western North
America on March 8, 1989.  The first total solar eclipse over Finland
since 1945 occurred on July 22, 1990.  On July 11, 1991, 40 million
people viewed a solar eclipse with six minutes of totality, the
longest until 2132.

On August 16, 1989, a total eclipse of the moon was visible from North
and South America, Western Europe, Africa, and the Antarctic.  </SUM>
