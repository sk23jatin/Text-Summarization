   A partial solar eclipse visible across
western North America bored scientists but thrilled crowds that were
able to see it despite clouds covering parts of the region.
   ``It's fabulous to know this is actually taking place. It's very
fascinating,'' said Edie Lurie, an employee at the California
Institute of Technology in Pasadena, where dozens used solar
telescopes to watch the moon eclipse 37 percent of the sun at 9:50
a.m. PST Tuesday.
   As the moon passed between the Earth and sun to cause the partial
eclipse, it was possible to see mountains on the edge of the moon
silhouetted against the sun. Also visible were gas jets on the sun's
surface and a giant group of sunspots that on Monday and Tuesday
produced major solar flares _ eruptions of heat and radiation _
including the largest since 1984.
   Clouds over downtown Salt Lake City dashed Hansen Planetarium's
plans to set up telescopes to watch the moon block 36 percent of the
sun at 11:10 a.m. MST.
   ``It's a bummer, but that's the way it goes,'' planetarium
spokesman Patrick Wiggins said.
   The eclipse was visible to at least some extent west of a
diagonal line stretching roughly from Mazatlan, Mexico, northeast to
Dallas and Chicago. Views were best farther west and north.
   In sunny Los Angeles, 600 schoolchildren and at least 400 other
people watched the eclipse at Griffith Observatory through
telescopes and other devices equipped with filters to prevent eye
injury.
   ``There was a childlike delight with the wonder of nature,''
observatory Director Ed Krupp said.
   Most astronomers were unimpressed, saying they were waiting for a
total solar eclipse that will sweep across Hawaii, the Pacific
Ocean, lower Baja California in Mexico, Central America, Colombia
and Brazil on July 11, 1991.
   ``You can see a partial eclipse every three or four years,'' said
Caltech astrophysicist Ken Libbrecht. ``They're not that exciting. A
total eclipse is exciting.''
   In Tucson, dozens of citizens peered through telescopes on the
University of Arizona mall to see the moon eclipse 23 percent of the
sun at 10:55 a.m. MST, but 90 solar scientists stayed inside,
attending a five-day conference titled ``The Sun in Time.''
   ``That's partly my fault,'' said conference co-organizer Mark
Giampapa, an astronomer at the National Solar Observatory. ``I
should have listed it in the program: `Partial eclipse, presented by
God.'''
   In Anchorage, Alaska, where the moon obscured 80 percent of the
sun at 9:13 a.m. AST, the eclipse was watched by 26 students from
Bartlett High School, several people wearing welders helmets as
filters and Providence Hospital workers who ended a staff meeting
early to see the spectacle.
   Clouds parted long enough to allow a glimpse of the eclipse for
100 people outside the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry in
often rainy Portland.
   ``Typical Oregon astronomy,'' said amateur astronomer Dan Dunn.
``You always have to deal with the clouds.''
   Scientists had warned against staring at the sun directly or
through inadequate filters, including smoked glass and photographic
film or filters.
   Alan MacRobert of Sky &amp; Telescope magazine said 245 eye injuries
were reported in the United States after an eclipse in 1970, but
warnings about the danger reduced the number to three during a 1984
partial eclipse.
