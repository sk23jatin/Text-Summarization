<LEADPARA>  Shortly before 10:30 this morning California time, nature turned off the sun's
light switch and total darkness over Hawaii signaled the beginning of the "The
Eclipse of the Millennium.";    "Oh, my God," exclaimed one spectator after
another at a mountaintop observatory atop Mauna Kea as the sky went blank.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "That's the best eclipse I've ever seen. That is truly spectacular," said
Don Hall, director of Hawaii's Institute for Astronomy.;    More than 40
million people saw the moon obscure so much of the sun that only a blazing
ring was visible in the western Americas. Shadows stretched from west to east,
as the eclipse turned morning into a night along a 160-mile-wide swath from
Hawaii to Baja to Mexico City to Calamar, Colombia -- the only region where
the eclipse made the Earth totally dark.;    In Hawaii, the volcano Mauna Loa
stunned visiting astronomers by producing a dazzling show of steam and glowing
lava at the height of the eclipse. Local geologists, though, indicated the
activity was probably routine.;    In the Bay Area, more than half the sun was
covered when the eclipse peaked at 11:20 a.m. The world will not see such a
long-lasting eclipse for another 151 years.;    Few people who saw it today
will forget "The Big One.";    "It looks neat. It looks like someone took a
bite out of an apple," said Matthew Mauranoh, 8, of Mountain View, who peered
through a homemade black box at the Foothill Observatory.;    The view was
diminished for many in Hawaii and Mexico, where low cloud cover obscured the
celestial display.;    As totality arrived at sea level on the Big Island, the
sun was hidden in some places by a cloud layer. At the astronomy observatory
at the top of 13,800-foot Mauna Kea, high cirrus clouds thwarted three of the
10 scientific experiments.;    But scientists were still struck by the sight
of two plumes of flame extending out 100,000 miles from the sun, one directly
on the top of the sun and one at the bottom. Both were colored bright fuchsia.
Another impressive feature was that the sun's corona, which stretched out for
a million miles around the sun, was not symmetrical, but jagged, with spikes
and valleys.;    The eclipse ended in a little more than six minutes with a
dazzling "diamond ring" effect on the rim as the first rays of sun emerged
from behind the moon.;    It still got dark below the mountain, but the clouds
disappointed about 500 people gathered on the driving range at the Mauna Lani
resort in south Kohala. Because of the clouds, most were unable to see the
stages of the eclipse until it got totally dark. Spectators' hopes had fallen
and risen in the previous hour as the clouds came and went.;    "I came
especially for this, and hope we get to see it," said Margaret MacLeod, a
mathematics and science teacher from Manhattan Beach shortly before the
eclipse in Hawaii. "If we don't get to see it, I may have to go to Iraq for
the next one.";    In the Bay Area, mostly sunny skies made eclipse-watching a
treat, except along the coast, where it was obscured by fog.;    Parks,
parking lots, shopping centers, back yards and planetariums became
Eclipsefests as the peak approached.;    More than a hundred sun gazers showed
up at the Branham Lane Park in South San Jose with almost as many gizmos to
help them spot sunspots and watch the moon cross the sun.;    There were funny
Mylar glasses, big pinhole projectors, small pinhole projectors, welder's
glass, welder's masks, binoculars projecting images onto cardboard and
telescopes.;    None was as impressive as Ralph Reeves' interference
birefrigent hydrogen alpha filter telescope. All most of us need to know is
that it takes electricity (provided by a gas generator) to run. And that you
can take pictures of the eclipse through it. That is, if you have film.;    "I
didn't bring any film with me," said Reeves, a retired Lockheed instrument
builder. "Isn't that awful?";    At the Children's Discovery Museum in
downtown San Jose, hundreds of youngsters and adults made cardboard
telescopes, which projected the eclipse on white cards through a needle hole
opening. Using mirrors, the eclipse also was projected on the exterior walls
of the lavender-colored museum.;    "We wanted to make little theaters for all
of the kids to see the eclipse without burning their eyes," said Paul
Stonecipher, a discovery museum staff guide.;    For nearly a week now, Hawaii
has been turned into an eclipse theme park. More than 500 astronomers and tens
of thousands of amateurs flocked to the islands to sell nearly everything
under the sun.;    Sun-minded entrepreneurs hawked eclipse T-shirts (60
different designs), hats, posters and cookies. There was even an eclipse
haircut and, of course, an eclipse drink at the Eclipse restaurant in
Kailua-Kona.;    "Everything is selling pretty well except for the eclipse
Frisbees. Nobody wants eclipse Frisbees," said "Wild Bill" Lawrence, who
helped out at Moonshadows, one of many small shops set up to sell eclipse
mementos.;    One church offered a nightly eclipse service. Another invited
visitors to "come worship with the sun.";    On the commercial strip in Kona,
the Big Island's equivalent of Fisherman's Wharf, the eclipse attracted a
human mass equivalent to the flock that attends the island's annual Iron Man
Triathalon.;    "Most of the scientists who are serious about it are on the
north part of the island," Mary Beth Black, a Kona health food store owner,
told Bay Area radio listeners. "The people here for the fun of it are here in
Kona.";    In Mexico City, the eclipse melded with the city's famed smog. The
Anthropology Museum held a ritual depicting the moon attempting to eat the
sun. Guatemalan Indian villagers, who worry during eclipses that the sun will
disappear forever, rang church bells and banged pots and pans to resurrect it.  </TEXT>
