   A total lunar eclipse visible from five
continents occurs after sunset Wednesday when the full moon orbits
into the shadow of the Earth and slowly turns from a bright silver
into a copper or orange disk.
   More than a billion people will have a chance to watch as the
moon appears to be slowly nibbled away, changing from the normal
bright reflected light of a full moon into the colorful glow of
eclipse.
   The celestial show starts at 8:23 p.m. EDT over the United
States and will end about 5{ hours later. The eastern United States
will get the best viewing and Alaska will miss the eclipse
altogether.
   Visible eclipse phases will vary for the central and western
parts of the country because of the difference in sunset and
moonrise. In Los Angeles, for instance, the eclipse will have
started before the sun has set or the moon has risen. By the time
the sky has darkened completely in California, the moon will
already be in the deepest part of its eclipse. For Seattle, the
moon will still be below the horizon at mid-eclipse, but will rise
during the totality phase.
   Clouds, of course, could ruin the viewing at any location.
   With clear skies, though, some phase of the celestial spectacle
should be visible to observers in North and South America, western
Europe and Africa, and the Antarctic. Sailors at sea in the
Atlantic and in the eastern Pacific Ocean also will be able to see
part of the eclipse, weather permitting.
   A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes through the shadow
created by the Earth blocking the sun's light. The moon, in its
orbit of the Earth, usually passes above or below this shadowline,
but every few years it follows a path that puts it completely in
shade for a time. When the whole moon passes through the shadow, it
is called a total eclipse.
   The last total lunar eclipse visible over most of North America
occurred in December 1982, and the next one is not until December
1992.
   Astronomers are forecasting that Wednesday's eclipse may be a
bright one.
   The moon can appear during an eclipse to be a bright coppery red
if there is clear, clean air between the lunar surface and the
observer on Earth. If smoke or dust obscure the view, the moon will
diminish to an orange color or perhaps even fade from view
altogether.
   Volcanic eruptions historically have dimmed eclipse viewing by
dumping tons of dust into the atmosphere. But astronomers say
enough time has passed since the last major volcanic eruption that
most dust has settled.
   The eclipse starts when the moon enters what is called the
penumbra. This outer fringe of the Earth's shadow will show up on
the moon as a grayish shading. After about half an hour, the moon
will edge into the umbra, the dark, central part of the shadow.
Total eclipse, when all of the moon is covered by the umbra, will
begin at about 10:20 p.m. EDT and last for one hour, 36 minutes.
   When the moon leaves the umbra, the events will occur in reverse
order. The eclipse ends about 1:53 a.m. EDT when the moon edges out
of the shadow altogether.
   While a lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth blocks sunlight from
the moon, a solar eclipse is caused when the moon blocks sunlight
from the Earth.
   To experts, a solar eclipse is more interesting because it
permits unique measurements of the sun.
   ``Solar eclipses attract a lot of scientific attention,'' said
John Bangert, a U.S. Naval Observatory astronomer in Washington.
``A lunar eclipse is just a good show.''
   Here is when the various phases of the eclipse will occur. All
times are Eastern daylight.
   Moon enters penumbra: 8:23 p.m.
   Moon enters umbra: 9:21 p.m.
   Moon enters totality: 10:20 p.m.
   Middle of Eclipse: 11:08 p.m.
   Moon leaves totality: 11:56 p.m.
   Moon leaves umbra: 12:56 a.m., Thursday.
   Moon leaves penumbra: 1:53 a.m.
   Because of the differences in sunset and moonrise times, viewing
will start at different eclipse phases in the western parts of the
country.
   Here are times for the local events that affect eclipse viewing.
The first hour is for local sunset and the second is for local
moonrise. The best viewing will follow twilight which ends about 25
minutes after sunset. Local time zones apply in all cases:
   Baltimore: Sunset at 8 p.m. Moonrise at 7:53 p.m.
   Boston: 7:43 p.m. and 7:36 p.m.
   Chicago: 7:49 p.m. and 7:43 p.m.
   Cleveland: 8:25 p.m. and 8:18 p.m.
   Houston: 8:01 p.m. and 7:55 p.m.
   Kansas City, Mo.: 8:12 p.m. and 8:06 p.m.
   Los Angeles: 7:39 p.m. and 7:35 p.m.
   Philadelphia: 7:56 p.m. and 7:48 p.m.
   Salt Lake City: 8:24 p.m. and 8:20 p.m.
   San Francisco: 8:01 p.m. and 7:58 p.m.
   Seattle: 8:20 p.m. and 8:16 p.m.
   St. Louis: 7:54 p.m. and 7:47 p.m.
   Washington: 8:01 p.m. and 7:54 p.m.
