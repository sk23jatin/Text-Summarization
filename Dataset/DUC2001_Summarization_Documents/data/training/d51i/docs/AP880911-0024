   Hundreds of thousands of Hindu
pilgrims plunged into sacred rivers and pools during a solar
eclipse Sunday, believing they would be freed of sin and attain
salvation. Authorities said a 12-year-old boy drowned.
   As the moon partially passed between the Earth and sun,
worshipers chanted hymns and blew conch shells. About 3,000 naked
holy men waded into the giant sacred pools of Sannihit and
Brahmsarovar, followed in turns by an estimated 500,000 men and
women, some clothed, others naked.
   Many carried coconuts, auspicious symbols for Hindus, and set
them in the water. Others gave alms to beggars or Hindu priests,
who offered prayers to the sun. There is an ancient belief that the
sun is in pain during an eclipse and prayers must be offered for
its relief.
   The scene was repeated, in smaller numbers, at rivers and pools
across India.
   An epic Hindu poem, the ``Mahabharata,'' promises salvation to
those who bathe or give alms at Kurukshetra during a solar eclipse.
   Kurukshetra's larger pool, Brahmasarovar, has a two-mile
perimeter. Sannihit's perimeter is about half that size. The pools
can accomodate 125,000 people.
   Thousands of police stood guard and directed traffic in the town
of 25,000 people about 90 miles north of New Delhi. Divers and
lifeguards kept watch over the bathers but could not save the
12-year-old boy from drowning, authorities said.
   The eclipse, which lasted about 90 minutes, was the third in the
past year. The others occurred on March 18 and Sept. 13, 1987.
   According to Hindu legend, Kurukshetra was created by the Hindu
god Lord Brahma and was the scene of an ancient battle in which
Lord Vishnu, the protector of the Hindu diety, pleaded for
righteousness.
