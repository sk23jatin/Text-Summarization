   Six organizations are asking news media around
the world to publicize the fourth anniversary of Terry Anderson's
kidnapping on Thursday.
   ``Today, March 16, 1989, the American journalist Terry Anderson,
41, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press in
Beirut, entered his fifth year of captivity as a hostage in
Lebanon,'' said a statement that the groups asked broadcasters to
air and newspapers to use on their front pages.
   The ``statement of solidarity with Anderson'' is from ``the
leading freedom of expression organizations in the Western world,''
Anne Nelson, executive director of the New York-based Committee to
Protect Journalists, said Monday.
   Ms. Nelson said she also will read the statement Thursday at the
National Press Club in Washington during a news conference
announcing her group's ``annual attacks-on-the-press report.''
   A speech by Vice President Dan Quayle on freedom of the press is
scheduled at the Press Club later Thursday.
   ``We call on President Bush and Vice President Quayle to use
every possible means at their disposal to bring Terry Anderson and
the other hostages home,'' Ms. Nelson said.
   Other organizations urging publication of the anniversary
statement are: Article 19 of London; International Federation of
Publishers in Paris; the International Federation of Journalists in
Brussels; Index on Censorship in London; and Observatoire de
L'Information in France.
   In a separate letter to its members, the 150,000-member
International Federation of Journalists said: ``On March 16, another
shameful date in the calendar passes _ the fourth anniversary of
captivity for American journalist Terry Anderson, who is held
hostage in Beirut.''
   The IFJ asked its members in 37 nations to draw attention to the
plight of British journalist John McCarthy, who marked his 1,000th
day of captivity on Jan. 10.
   The IFJ said it will place advertisements in Beirut newspapers to
urge the release of all hostages.
   IFJ members also were urged to send letters requesting diplomatic
initiatives to the ambassadors of the United States, the United
Kingdom, Syria and Iran and to ``publicize the plight of the
journalists'' in union journals and national media.
   In London, IFJ Secretary General Aidan White will be accompanied
by McCarthy's girlfriend, Gill Morell, and several trade union
leaders when they meet with U.S. Embassy officials.
   Elsewhere, Charles Dale, the president of the Newspaper Guild of
the United States and Canada, will lead a delegation to the U.S.
State Department in Washington on Thursday.
   In Strasbourg, France, Doornaert and French journalist Jean-Paul
Kauffmann, a former hostage in Lebanon, will meet with European
Parliament leaders to press for the hostages' release.
