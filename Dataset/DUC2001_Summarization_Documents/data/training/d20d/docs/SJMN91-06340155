<LEADPARA>  A nearly seven-year-long journey through Beirut's heart of darkness ended
Wednesday for Terry Anderson, the longest-held of the Western hostages in
Lebanon, bringing almost to a close a chapter of Middle East history that
brought successive U.S. administrations to frustrated impotence before a
shadowy group of radical Muslims.;   Anderson arrived in Germany early today
and was reunited with the sister who campaigned tirelessly for his release.  </LEADPARA>

IN CAPTIVITY  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>     Peggy Say dashed forward and gave her brother a huge hug after he stepped
down from the helicopter at the U.S. Air Force hospital in Wiesbaden.;  
Anderson appeared minutes later on a hospital balcony with Joseph Cicippio and
Alann Steen, the other two American hostages freed this week.;   After a
daylong delay that U.N. officials attributed to snow-blocked roads, Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent for the Associated Press, had appeared
Wednesday before his colleagues at a press conference in Damascus, Syria, and
said, "You can't imagine how glad I am to see you.";   The 44-year-old
journalist, who was abducted March 16, 1985, by the Islamic Jihad faction of
Iranian-backed Lebanese Shiite Muslims, looked to be in good health and said
he was sustained in his long ordeal by his companions in captivity, his
religious faith and his "stubbornness.";   "You wake up every day. You summon
up energy from somewhere. I don't know how," Anderson said as he continuously
searched the packed room in the Syrian Foreign Ministry for Beirut-based
friends and colleagues, waving and giving them the thumbs-up sign.;   At the
news conference in Syria, Anderson said his captors came to his cell Tuesday
afternoon with new clothes -- the first new apparel he had worn in almost
seven years -- and a pair of new shoes that were pinching his feet.;   When
asked what his last words were to his captors, Anderson said simply,
"Goodbye," and laughed.;   After the news conference, he met with Madeleine
Bassil, whom he was planning to marry when he was kidnapped, and his
6-year-old daughter, Sulome, whom he had never seen before Wednesday. In his
long captivity, Anderson had treasured a photo of Sulome that his kidnappers
allowed him to receive.;   Anderson was the ninth Western hostage to be freed
since August. His release came after months of negotiations led by a special
U.N. envoy, Giandomenico Picco, who dealt with Iranians, Israelis and the
Lebanese kidnappers.;   In Washington, President Bush, who called Anderson in
Damascus "to express the love and admiration that all Americans have for
Terry," said Wednesday he joined Anderson's family and friends "in their
happiness for his return to freedom.";   The ordeal isn't over;   But he said:
"While the American hostages have now been released, we cannot say the ordeal
is over. We call for the immediate, safe and unconditional release of all
those held outside the legal system in the region, including the two German
hostages.";   Muslim sources in Beirut and Iranian officials have said Thomas
Kemptner, 30, and Heinrich Streubig, 50, who were kidnapped May 16, 1989, are
expected to be released soon.;   Bush said the United States still wanted a
"full accounting" of all hostages who reportedly have died or been killed in
captivity.;   Bush called for the immediate return of the remains of Marine
Lt. Col. William Higgins and former CIA station chief William Buckley, both of
whom were killed by hostage-takers in Lebanon. Higgins headed a U.N. observer
force and Buckley was stationed in Beirut.;   White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater criticized Iran, with whom most of the hostage-taking groups had
allied themselves, as "still a terrorist state," and insisted that the United
States had made no deals to gain the release of the U.S. hostages.;   In a
great mood;   Anderson appeared to be in an ebullient mood as he joked with
his questioners. Asked how he felt about being labeled the longest-held
Western hostage, he replied, "It's an honor I'd have gladly given up long
ago.";   Anderson wore dark slacks, a white shirt and a dark sweater. He also
wore a pair of glasses precariously perched on his nose with part of the frame
missing.;   He said his spirits were kept up by listening to British
Broadcasting Corp. newscasts on a radio provided by his kidnappers in the
later period of his captivity, and that he was particularly grateful for
messages from his family that reached him through Lebanese reporters.;  
Before he was released, Anderson read a videotaped message from Islamic Jihad.
The tape preceded him to Damascus, where it was handed to an AP reporter.;  
"Although we are closing the file of the captives," the statement declared,
"this doesn't mean the confrontation with the Americans and Israelis is
halted. The captivity of some persons is only one of the styles to confront. .
. . The war is going on.";   Anderson said he made clear that it was the
kidnappers' statement, not his, "but I thought it was worthwhile to listen to
what they had to say.";   The good news for the hostage in the statement was
brief but meaningful: "We're going to free our last captive, Terry Anderson,
thus folding this page in the hostage file before glorious Christmas."; What
he missed; Some of the events Terry Anderson missed during his time in
captivity:; (box)1985: Cruise ship Achille Lauro seized by Palestinians.;
