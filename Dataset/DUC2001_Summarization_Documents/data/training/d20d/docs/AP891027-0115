   Terry Anderson spent a fifth birthday as
a hostage today, a grim milestone in his captivity.
   His relatives and friends marked the event with a flood of
messages and with a Mass in Washington. Radio reports said
Lebanon's three television stations would screen a birthday message
from his 4-year-old daughter, Sulome.
   The daily newspapers An-Nahar and As-Safir and the
French-language L'Orient-Le Jour published English texts of letters
to Anderson, the chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press who was abducted March 16, 1985.
   His sister, Peggy Say, wrote, ``In honor of your birthday on
Friday, we will be in Washington with other hostage families to
mark another sad year in which you have been denied your freedom.''
   The Journalists' Committee to Free Terry Anderson, made up of
colleagues from all over the United States, wrote: ``Please believe
that not a day passes when we do not think of you and pray for
you.''
   The Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan said it was sending a
33-foot birthday scroll to Anderson signed by 59 journalists and
former colleagues in Tokyo.
   Anderson was a member of the club during a working assignment in
Japan 1979-1981.
   Prominent journalists, along with representatives of the State
Department and the embassies of Lebanon, Algeria and Syria,
attended a Mass in Georgetown University's Dahlgren Chapel, where
Mrs. Say said such ceremonies ensure her brother will not be
forgotten.
   Gunmen seized the 42-year-old Anderson in Moslem west Beirut
after a game of tennis that had been a brief respite from his
reporting on Lebanon's civil war.
   He has not held Sulome, born three months after the morning he
was kidnapped. He probably does not know that his father and
brother died of cancer.
   Anderson's fate now appears to be caught up in a power struggle
between Shiite Moslem radicals and moderates.
   He was kidnapped by Islamic Jihad, a group loyal to Iran whose
name means Islamic Holy War. His abductors demand the release of 15
men imprisoned in Kuwait for bombing the U.S. and French embassies
in 1983.
   Islamic Jihad also holds Thomas Sutherland, 57, an American who
was acting dean of agriculture at American University of Beirut.
Sutherland was kidnapped June 9, 1985.
   Police say Lebanese authorities have no information on the
whereabouts of Anderson or the 15 other Western hostages in Lebanon.
   Four days ago, Islamic Jihad made its first statement in a year,
reviving an old offer to trade Anderson and Sutherland for their
comrades jailed in Kuwait.
   A copy of the statement delivered to a Western news agency in
Beirut was accompanied by a photograph of Anderson similar to one
released Nov. 4, 1988, after his last birthday.
   The statement was seen as a response to a declaration Monday by
President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran that he would use its
influence to free the hostages if the United States released
Iranian assets worth up to $12 billion that have been frozen since
1979.
   Kuwait has refused to free the prsoners, but two members of the
group were released in February after completing five-year
sentences. The United States has said it will not negotiate with
terrorists.
   Anderson and Sutherland are among eight American hostages, most
believed held by pro-Iranians.
   Islamic Jihad issued its statement as the leader of Iran's
revolutionary radicals, former Interior Minister Ali Akbar
Mohtashemi, was on a three-week visit to Lebanon. He met with
prominent Shiites, including leading figures in Hezbollah, believed
to be the umbrella group for kidnap gangs.
   It was not clear why Mohtashemi, Rafsanjani's main political
rival, came to Lebanon. But the trip underlined his power struggle
with Rafsanjani, leader of the comparatively moderate
``pragmatists'' who want to restore relations with the West.
   A knowledgeable Shiite said privately the Islamic Jihad
statement was ``a clear indication that the hostage-holders are not
under Rafsanjani's control.''
   Hezbollah appears to have split into factions, with the main
groups supporting either Rafsanjani or Mohtashemi.
   Rafsanjani dismissed Mohtashemi after his election as president
July 28. The former interior minister's surprise appearance in
Lebanon quashed reports from Tehran that he was under house arrest.
Mohtashemi returned to Tehran on Wednesday via Damascus, Syria.
   Since he was kidnapped, Anderson has been allowed to write a few
letters to his family and occasionally to see Lebanese newspaper
and television reports about relatives.
   American and French hostages who shared his captivity and were
released have told of his courage and fears, how he has defied his
captors and suffered the agonies of captivity.
   His father, Glenn, and elder brother, Glenn Jr., died of cancer
in 1986. Released hostages said he did not know of the deaths.
   Anderson knows his daughter, Sulome, was born June 7, 1985, but
has seen her only in a few seconds of film his captors allowed him
to watch on Lebanese TV, according to letters from him released by
the kidnappers.
