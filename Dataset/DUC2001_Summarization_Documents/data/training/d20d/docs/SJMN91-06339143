Anderson had been freed today by his Shiite Muslim captors and was safely in
Syrian hands.;   The statement followed contradictory reports earlier about
the whereabouts of Anderson, who had been held 6 1/2 years and was the last

<TEXT>     Perez de Cuellar, who oversaw the negotiations for the release of Western
hostages, said in New York that Anderson was with Syrian officials in
Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, and heavy snow has delayed his transfer to Damascus.; 
 "I am sure this is a technical problem. I think mainly due to snow, the usual
road they use to go from somewhere in Lebanon to Damascus," Perez de Cuellar
said.;   "I'm still hopeful it will take place today," he said, referring to
Anderson's anticipated arrival in Damascus and his hand-over to U.S.
officials.;   "He is on his way, and he is being protected by the Syrians, I
imagine, because I think he must be in the Bekaa Valley," the
secretary-general said.;   Earlier today, it was not clear where Anderson was,
despite reports from Arab and U.S. officials that he was released and turned
over to the Syrians.;   Anderson, 44, an Associated Press correspondent, had
said in a videotaped statement that he was to be freed. The tape, released
very early this morning by his captors, gave no indication when that would
happen. It was not known when the videotape was made.;   An accompanying
five-page Arabic-language statement from the Islamic Jihad group, which has
held Anderson for 2,455 days, also announced that he would be set free.;   In
the initial portion of the tape, Anderson read the Islamic Jihad statement in
English, which he said he did not agree with. Among other things, it denounced
the group's enemies and accused Israel of blocking the hostage-freeing
process.;   "This is the statement of my captors," Anderson said after reading
the kidnappers' statement. "Mine is only that with my release, and I hope soon
the release of the two Germans and all the Lebanese held in Israel, this
tactic (hostage-taking) will never be used again.;   "The causes of this
troubled episode are complex and difficult. It is these causes which must be
redressed and eliminated. The holding of innocent people by anyone solves
nothing," he added.;   Anderson, wearing a dark sweater and white shirt, spoke
in a clear voice. He appeared in good physical condition.;   At the White
House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said U.S. officials had no official word
that reports of Anderson's release were true.;   Anderson is the third
American hostage freed in three days.;   Eight other Westerners have been
freed since August, when the United Nations launched negotiations involving a
complex swap of Western hostages, hundreds of Arabs held by Israel, and
information about missing Israeli servicemen.;   "We are immensely relieved
that Terry Anderson's 6 1/2-year nightmare is over," said Louis D. Boccardi,
Associated Press president and chief executive officer, following the initial
reports of Anderson's release.;   "He has paid a terrible price for his
commitment to stay with his story. We welcome him back with warmth, affection
and the deepest respect for what he has endured," he said.;   As chief Middle
East correspondent, Anderson headed the Associated Press office Beirut from
1983 until he was kidnapped on March 16, 1985. Staff members uncorked
champagne today to toast his freedom.;   The Syrians had said earlier that
Anderson would be handed over to U.S. Ambassador Christopher Ross at the
Foreign Ministry.;   Anderson's daughter Sulome, born three months after he
was kidnapped, was driven to the U.S. Embassy with her mother Madeleine by
American officials. They had flown to Damascus from their home in Cyprus.;  
Anderson's estranged wife, Mihoko, and their 15-year-old daughter Gabrielle,
who live in Tokyo, declined comment.;   The hostage saga has been moving
toward an end for the United States amid changing political alignments in the
Middle East after the Persian Gulf war and the end of the Cold War, moves by
Iran to improve ties with Washington and skillful U.N. mediation.;   In all,
dozens of foreigners have been held hostage by Shiite groups in Lebanon since
1984. Of these, 11 have been reported or confirmed dead in captivity, 38 not
including Anderson were released or escaped.;   In exchange for the hostage
releases, the kidnappers were reported by Iran's Tehran Radio this week to
have been promised that they would not be pursued by the United States,
Germany or any other country.;   The hostage-holders have in the past few
years been isolated by the desire of Syria and Iran to improve ties with the
West.;   Iran, long the chief backer of Lebanese kidnappers, and Syria had
pressed amid shifting international alliances for the Western hostages'
freedom.;   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani is seeking to end Iran's
isolation and shed its image as an outlaw state that supports terrorism. The
Syrians, once the vanguard of Arab radicalism and a longtime Soviet ally, are
realigning with the West after the collapse of communism.;   This week's
releases follow by days Washington's payment to Iran of $278 million for
weaponry impounded during the 1979-80 Tehran hostage crisis. The weapons and
other Iranian assets were frozen by the United States in 1979. Tehran has in
the past linked hostage releases to the return of those assets.;   The U.N.
negotiations for the Western hostages are expected to ultimately involve
freedom for 300 Arab prisoners held by Israel and its proxy militia in
Lebanon. Israel seeks an accounting of four missing servicemen in Lebanon.;  
On Sunday, Israel released 25 Arab prisoners, bringing to 91 the number set
free since August and giving new impetus to hostage releases.;   The two
Germans still held are Thomas Kemptner and Heinrich Struebig. An Italian,
Alberto Molinari, is missing, but reports say he is dead.  </TEXT>
