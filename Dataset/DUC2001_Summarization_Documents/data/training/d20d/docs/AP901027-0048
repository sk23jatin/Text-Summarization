   Hundreds of demonstrators blocked
streets and train tracks today, halting most traffic in the capital
to press their demands for President Hussain Muhammad Ershad to
resign.
   Stores and offices closed, apparently out of fear of attacks,
when what was intended to be a blockade of transport turned into a
general strike.
   Groups of about 50 demonstrators staged sit-down strikes at
about two dozen rail and road intersections in and around Dhaka, a
city of 7 million people.
   Many people walked to work. Even bicycle-powered rickshaws,
Dhaka's chief mode of transport, stayed off the streets.
   Protesters paraded through the streets shouting ``Down with
Ershad!'' and ``Days of Autocracy Are Over!''
   United News of Bangladesh said 4,000 police and paramilitary
troops were deployed in Dhaka. There were no reports of violence by
midday.
   The blockade was the latest tactic in the campaign by opposition
parties to force Ershad to quit. At least eight people have been
killed by police since the current round of protests started Oct.
10.
   ``We are happy to see that the blockade has turned into a hartal
(general strike). This shows popular support for our cause,'' said
Suranjit Sengupta, a top leader of the Democratic Party. It is one
of eight parties in an alliance headed by the Awami League led by
Sheik Hasina, one of the country's main opposition politicians.
   Ershad has dismissed the campaign against him as ``the work of a
handful of violence-mongers who are out to destabilize
Bangladesh.''
   He was an army general when he seized power in a bloodless coup
in 1982. He later resigned from the military and was elected
president in 1986 in balloting that opposition parties, foreign
diplomats and journalists said was rigged.
   He plans to seek another five-year term in elections scheduled
for next year. The opposition parties say they will boycott the
vote unless Ershad resigns and hands over power to a caretaker
government.
