<LEADPARA>  Terry Anderson, the last American hostage in Lebanon, walked free today of his
pro-Iranian Shiite Muslim kidnappers. His release ended a brutal saga that
kept 15 Americans in chains, left three dead and bedeviled two U.S.
presidencies.;   A flurry of contradictory reports early in the day about
Anderson's whereabouts mirrored the agonizing cycle of raised and dashed hopes
for release from his 6 1/2-year ordeal.  </LEADPARA>

HOPES ARE REALIZED AS CAPTORS RELEASE LAST U.S.
HOSTAGE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     It was a painful day for his relatives and friends.;   "It's been like a
big roller coaster ride about his release," Anderson's 36-year-old brother
John said from his home in Ocala, Fla. "But that's the way it's been for
almost seven years.";   He was handed over to U.S. officials in Damascus after
hours of delay apparently caused by snow in the mountainous terrain from
Beirut, Lebanon.;   Anderson, 44, was the third American hostage freed in
three days, and his release ended an agonizing drama for the United States.
Two Germans still are held in Lebanon, however, and U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar said his work would not be over until they are
released.;   He has led delicate negotiations involving a complex swap of
Western hostages, hundreds of Arabs held by Israel and information about
missing Israeli military personnel.;   Eight other Westerners have been freed
since August, when the United Nations launched negotiations involving a
complex swap of Western hostages, hundreds of Arabs held by Israel, and
information about missing Israelis. Two German hostages are still being held.;
  The secretary-general said at U.N. headquarters that no deal had been made
by U.N. officials guaranteeing the hostage-takers immunity from retaliation.; 
 In exchange for the hostage releases, the kidnappers were reported by Iran's
Tehran Radio this week to have been promised that they would not be pursued by
the United States, Germany or any other country.;   Confusion about Anderson's
whereabouts arose after a five-page Arabic-language statement from the Islamic
Jihad group that held Anderson announced today he would be set free, but its
wording was unclear as to whether he had already been released.;   Anderson
said in a videotaped statement released today by his captors to the Associated
Press in Damascus that he was to be freed. The tape gave no indication of when
that would happen.;   American, Syrian and Lebanese officials initially said
Anderson had been freed and turned over to Syrian troops in Lebanon. Later,
however, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa said, "We hope he will be
released this evening -- the sooner the better.";   The Syrians said Anderson
would be handed over to U.S. Ambassador Christopher Ross at the Foreign
Ministry.;   Anderson's daughter, Sulome, born three months after he was
kidnapped, was driven to the U.S. Embassy with her mother, Madeleine Bassil,
by American officials. They had flown to Damascus from their home in Cyprus.; 
 Despite the delay, there was a mood of calm and optimism among friends and
relatives who gathered to greet Anderson in Damascus.;   Anderson's estranged
wife, Mihoko, and their 15-year-old daughter Gabrielle, who live in Tokyo,
declined comment.;   Anderson's release marks the end of the seven-year
American hostage drama in Lebanon, which brought an outpouring of public
support for the captives and put intense pressure on the Reagan and Bush
administrations to get them out.;   The hostage saga comes to an end for the
United States amid changing political alignments in the Middle East after the
Persian Gulf war and the end of the Cold War, moves by Iran to improve ties
with Washington and skillful U.N. mediation.;   The hostage-holders have in
the past few years been isolated by the desire of Syria and Iran to improve
ties with the West.;   This week's releases follow by days Washington's
payment to Iran of $278 million for weaponry impounded during the 1979-80
Tehran hostage crisis. The weapons and other Iranian assets were frozen by the
United States in 1979. Tehran has in the past linked hostage releases to the
return of those assets.;   The two Germans still held are Thomas Kemptner and
Heinrich Struebig. An Italian, Alberto Molinari, is missing, but reports say
he is dead. The Germans were seized by Shiite militants seeking the release of
Mohammed and Abbas Hamadi, brothers imprisoned in Germany on terrorism
convictions.; Terry Anderson: chronology of captivity;   1985; March 16 -
