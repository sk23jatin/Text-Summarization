On March 16, 1985, Terry Anderson, chief Middle East Correspondent of
the Associated Press was abducted on a street in Beirut, Lebanon.  The
Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the kidnapping.

Eighteen Westerners, including eight Americans, are thought to be
captives in Lebanon.

In 1988, Anderson, 41, spends his fourth year in captivity.  Anderson
says in a videotape statement that he finds "it difficult to keep my
hope and courage high."

On March 16, 1989, his sister, Peggy Say, and other family members and
friends wrote greetings to Mr. Anderson that are published in the
French-language newspapers An- Nahar and As-Safir.

The birthplace of Terry Anderson marked the hostage's 43rd birthday
Saturday with a flag raising, a gun salute and two renditions of
"Happy Birthday."

As Terry Anderson began his sixth year as a hostage in 1990, his
four-year-old daughter, Sulome, pleaded for her father to be released.

That same year, his family, friends and colleagues marked the somber
anniversary with commemorations and prayers in cities around the
world.

But on December 4, 1991, after being held in Lebanese prisons for
nearly seven years, Anderson "the longest-held of the Western hostages
in Lebanon" was released.

At a press conference in Damascus, Syria, held the day after his
release, Anderson said his companions, his religious faith and his
"stubbornness" helped him cope.  </SUM>
