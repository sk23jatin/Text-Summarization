Pacific 'Ring of Fire'; Volcanoes that ring the Pacific Ocean rise from the
same fundamental process: Sections of the earth's surface, called plates, are
constantly moving over a layer of partially melted rock. Volcanic activity
occurs when plates collide or move apart, and the tremendous pressures in the
earth's interior melt the rock and push it toward the surface.  </CAPTION>

<LEADPARA>  Mount Pinatubo, the Philippine volcano that erupted Saturday after six
centuries of quiet, is likely to explode in the next few days or weeks with
force comparable to the Mount St. Helens explosion, a U.S. government
scientist said Monday.;    "I think we could see a major explosive eruption
anytime," said Peter Lipman, a volcanologist at the U.S. Geological Survey
office in Menlo Park. Lipman is in daily contact with five USGS scientists in
the Philippines who have been studying the volcano since April, when it first
stirred.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  See related story page 10A of this section.;  SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT
(publ. 6/12/91, pg. 2A);  Because of an editor's error, a story in Tuesday's
editions may have been misleading about the location of Mount Lassen. It is in
the Cascade Range, a continuation of the Sierra Nevada.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     If it does erupt, the deadly hot ash produced by the volcano could sweep
across adjoining Clark Air Base, he said. Also in peril are the 350,000
residents of Angeles City, where the air base is located, about 50 miles north
of Manila.;    Even if the volcano does not erupt, the threat of eruption is
likely to keep the base closed for weeks at least, Lipman said.;    Scientists
doubt it's more than coincidence that the eruption is occurring at the same
time as the Mount Unzen volcano in Japan, he said.;    The five USGS
scientists are among the few remaining people at Clark Air Base, which was
evacuated along with thousands of Filipinos living near the volcano.;    The
researchers, along with 10 Filipino scientists and their equipment, today 
moved to a bunker on the east edge of the air base, 12 miles from the volcano,
where they should be safe from ash avalanches.;    Mount Pinatubo is typical
of hundreds of volcanoes that make up the "Ring of Fire" on the Pacific coasts
of Asia and the Americas. (These volcanoes -- including Mount Lassen in the
Sierra Nevada, and Mount Rainier and Mount St. Helens in the Cascade Range --
arise where one of the earth's immense crust plates is slowly diving beneath
another.);    Pinatubo's last eruption, 600 years ago, is thought to have
yielded at least as much molten rock -- half a cubic kilometer -- as Mount St.
Helens did when it erupted in 1980. Until volcanologists' attention was drawn
to it by a cluster of earthquakes beneath the volcano this spring, it had not
been studied well.;    Waves of hot ash;  Other recent volcanoes that erupted
on the same scale were El Chichon in Mexico in 1983 and Nevado del Ruiz in
Colombia in 1985.;    If it does have a massive eruption, Pinatubo's primary
means of causing death and destruction would be hellish avalanches of hot ash
-- 1,000 degrees or more, flowing and billowing at up to 100 mph, engulfing
and searing all in their path.;    "In the worst case, a really big eruption,
all of Clark Air Force Base could be covered" with glowing ash, Lipman said.; 
  Just being caught in a cloud of ash blowing off the avalanche is fatal. That
is what killed 38 people in Japan last week.;    Risk to planes;  Such ash
also would wreak havoc with the engines of planes at the air base, Lipman
said.;    Planes flying through clouds of volcanic ash -- indistinguishable on
radar from rain clouds -- run the risk of having their engines stalled by the
grit.;    So far, the winds have blown ash away from the base. But winds of
the summer monsoon weather pattern, expected to begin any day, would send ash
directly toward the base.;    The volcano's activity -- measured by
seismometers detecting slight earthquakes in its molten rock plumbing system
-- is increasing in a way that suggests a large eruption is imminent, Lipman
said.;    The scientists also are monitoring tiltmeters on the volcano's
slopes, to watch it swell as magma builds inside. On clear days they fly above
the crater to measure sulfur emissions.;    No link to Japan;  Their
predictions might be a false alarm -- the volcano may have done its worst
already. But it would take several weeks of declining quakes and sulfur
emissions before scientists would be reasonably confident that the military
could return to the base.;    Volcanologists know of no reason the volcano's
activity could be linked to the volcano in Japan, which is of comparable
size.;    "No reputable scientist I know of" is drawing a connection between
the two, Lipman said.;    More than 500 volcanoes have erupted in historical
time, he noted. "Two out of 500 is no big deal."  </TEXT>
