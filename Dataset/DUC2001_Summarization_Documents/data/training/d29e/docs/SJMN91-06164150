<DESCRIPT>  VOLCANO; PHILIPPINES  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Mount Pinatubo erupted with three thundering explosions today, shooting a
giant plume of ash more than 12 miles high and chasing nearby residents away
with an outpouring of molten rock and hot gas.;    A Filipino serving with the
U.S. Navy became the first reported fatality related to the eruption when his
car collided with a bus on an ash-slicked road north of the Subic Bay naval
base.  </LEADPARA>

VOLCANO ON A RAMPAGE
ASH FILLS THE SKY; LAVA, GAS GUSH  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Residents of nearby Angeles panicked at the roar of the initial blast, and
thousands of people packed roads after a huge gray-greenish mushroom cloud
burst from the volcano and turned day to night.;    At a refugee center in
Olongapo, 35 miles southwest of the volcano, survivors told of the sky growing
dark, then of hearing a tremendous explosion followed by a rain of ash.;   
"Stones as big as my head were falling down from the mountains," said Rolly
Soria, 18.;    "There was panic everywhere," said Manuel Romualdo, who fled
with his wife, five children, a cat and a dog. "Children were crying. We had
to grab whatever we could.";    Scientists warned of more, possibly larger
eruptions from the 4,795-foot volcano, which was dormant for six centuries
until it began spewing steam in April.;    "This could only be the beginning,"
said Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology
and Seismology.;    Tens miles to the east, hundreds of Americans fled Clark
Air Base, home to 15,000 American military personnel and their families. Most
of the base's residents had been evacuated Monday.;    Clark did not appear
threatened by volcanic flow, and there were no immediate reports of
casualties.;    Seismologists said searing gas, ash and molten rock raced at
great speed down the mountain's western and northern slopes and into the
Marella, Maraunot and O'Donnell rivers.;    About 3,000 Aeta tribesman,
descendants of the original inhabitants of the Philippines, fled the slopes of
Mount Pinatubo.;    People scampered for safety with their belongings and
livestock over roads slippery with ash fall. Refugees wore cardboard boxes to
protect themselves from the ash.;    "They were stunned by the eruption,"
reporter Bert Basa said by telephone from Angeles. "Their faces turned ashen,
and it looked like their hair was standing on end.";    Ash was so thick in
the air that at noon, motorists were driving with their headlights on and
wipers operating to clear the windshields of volcanic debris. Bits of ash
wafted across the roads as if along a windy beach.;    A photographer who
circled the volcano in an airplane said an aerial gunnery range at Clark was
covered with ash, as were mountains in the Zambales range, normally lush,
green tropical peaks that now looked like the Alps in winter.;    Today's
eruptions began at 8:40 a.m. with a tremendous blast that sent forth a
mushroom cloud. It was followed by a second explosion a few minutes later and
a third, smaller blast at 11:49 a.m.;    The huge plume 12 1/2 miles high
could be seen in Manila, 60 miles to the south, and reporters at the scene
said it blocked out the sun. The cloud drifted westward into the South China
Sea.;    Seismologists said the volcano had plenty of built-up magma and even
more severe eruptions could come later.;    "The crisis has not ended," said
Punongbayan, of the Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology. "We
have signs that the volcano is preparing for another one.";    Punongbayan
warned people within a 12-mile radius of Pinatubo to flee.;    "The smoke is
very thick like a dark mushroom in the sky," television reporter Gus Abelgas
said in a broadcast from Botolan, near the volcano's western slopes. "It's
just like what we saw in Hiroshima.";    President Corazon Aquino visited
refugee centers near Angeles briefly before returning to Manila for
independence day celebrations.;    Moments after the first explosion, sirens
wailed at Clark Air Base, and 600 of the 1,500 Americans remaining there fled
eastward to safety. Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. Ron Rand said 900 Americans,
mostly security personnel, remained at the 130,000-acre base.;    Clark is one
of the biggest U.S. bases overseas. Punongbayan said Tuesday that the site was
in the path of the volcanic flow from Mount Pinatubo during its last major
eruption, in 1380.;    The Pentagon, which is trying to negotiate a new
contract with Manila for the base, said it can work around the temporary loss
of Clark.;    The Americans who fled Clark with a few belongings on Monday
moved in with sailors and their families at Subic Bay naval base, 50 miles to
the southwest.;    Although the Air Force left Clark, Philippine authorities
have not ordered a general evacuation of Angeles, a city of more than 300,000
people adjacent to the base.;    When Mount Pinatubo erupted today, church
bells pealed to sound the alarm and many people froze in their tracks with
fear. Many scampered for safety indoors.;    About 19,000 Filipinos had
earlier been evacuated from three provinces near the volcano's slopes and were
housed in about 25 makeshift evacuation centers outside the projected danger
zone.;    Officials said more were evacuated after today's eruption but they
could provide no new figures.;    In the Sapang Bato area of Angeles, the city
district nearest the volcano, just 2,000 of 13,000 residents had been
evacuated as of Monday, officials said.;    Reporters visiting the village
today found it abandoned except for a few chickens and cattle. Houses were
padlocked, but the explosion had shattered some windows.;    Private jeep and
bus companies were ordered to the area today to pick up stragglers. About 10
people in Moraza, a village on the western slope, were refusing to leave,
relief officials said. They told rescuers that they would not leave their
livestock and if the animals die, "we will die with them.";    On April 2,
Pinatubo produced a small hydrothermal explosion caused by underground water
meeting hot rocks deep inside.;    On June 3, the volcano spewed ash in a mild
eruption. That same day, 4,452-foot Mount Unzen in Japan erupted with an
explosion of superheated gas, ashes and rocks that killed 38 people.;    A
larger flow days later razed dozens of houses.;    Experts say there is
apparently no connection between Unzen and Pinatubo.;    There are about 21
active and 200 dormant volcanoes in the Philippines. The last major eruption
was the Taal volcano, about 50 miles south of Manila, in 1965. That explosion
killed about 200 people.  </TEXT>
