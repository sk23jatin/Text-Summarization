Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines began to smoulder a few weeks ago.
If it exploded, it would send a mass of molten lava and rock down the
slope toward Angeles, a city of 300,000 and the U.S. Clark Air Force
Base on Luzon.

A team of U.S. and Philippine volcanologists and seismologists began
taking readings on the mountains and decided that it was going to
erupt in the immediate future.  The alarm for early warning went out
and 84,000 people were evacuated from the area, including Clark Air
Base.  The warning came just in time.

Eruptions are caused by one of the earth's plates sliding under
another or moving apart.  The resultant pressure from the earth's
interior melts the rock forcing it to the surface.  In the case of
Mount Pinatubo, it had been 600 years since this had happened.

On Pinatubo, communications with the scientists were disrupted.  They
were last located in a prepared bunker.

The eruption occurred at the same time as Typhoon YUNYA and the two
forces of nature threatened to disrupt everything in their path.

U.S. - Philippine discussions on a bases treaty were also occurring
simultaneous with the eruptions. Clark Air Base may well be declared
inoperable.  </SUM>
