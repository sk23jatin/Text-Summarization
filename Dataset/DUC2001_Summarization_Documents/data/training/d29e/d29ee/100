Mount Pinatubo exploded in a mushroom cloud, hot ash and lava after
600 years of dormancy.

A team of U.S. and Philippine scientists were on the scene before the
explosion and provided ample warning before the eruption.  The early
warning gave 84,000 people, including military personnel from Clark
Air Base, a chance to flee the area.

The eruption occurred at the same time as Typhoon YUNYA and both went
on a path of destruction.

Meanwhile, the U.S. and Philippine governments were holding
discussions concerning a bases treaty, including Clark Air Force Base.
The latter may be declared inoperable.  </SUM>
