   Boris N. Yeltsin, the new president of the Russian
Federation and a leading critic of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said
Thursday he will try to make peace in his personal feud with the
Soviet president.
   Yeltsin, a radical reformer, was quoted by the official Tass news
agency as saying he would put aside personal differences with
Gorbachev when the president returns from the Washington summit.
   Yeltsin was seeking to calm the fears of the deputies of the
republic's Congress about his stormy relationship with Gorbachev,
his former mentor.
   In his new position as president of Russia, the largest Soviet
republic, Yeltsin has a formidable platform from which to challenge
and criticize Gorbachev, who opposed his election.
   Deputies speaking Thursday at the Russian Congress ``expressed
concern over the exchange of statements about each other'' by
Yeltsin and Gorbachev, Tass reported.
   Yeltsin answered that after Gorbachev returns June 4 from the
summit in Washington, ``I think we'll have an appropriate
conversation, and we'll resolve most issues without damaging the
sovereignty and aims of Russia,'' Tass said.
   At a news conference Wednesday, Yeltsin called for achieving
Russian ``sovereignty'' within 100 days. The term is used here to
mean not independence, but autonomy in most internal decisions.
   Yeltsin also urged the Kremlin to allow the other 14 republics to
enjoy the same autonomy, making the country a federation of states
that could overrule the central government on most matters.
   Although Yeltsin said he wanted a ``businesslike'' relationship
with Gorbachev, he also made an oblique call Thursday for Gorbachev
to give up one of his posts: either Soviet president or Communist
Party general secretary.
   ``I am against combining any post in one person. And I am talking
not just about the chairmanship of the party at the Russian level,
at the regional level, or at the local level,'' he said.
   In Ottawa on Tuesday, Gorbachev said he was ``somewhat
concerned'' about Yeltsin's victory and feared that if Yeltsin ``is
playing a political game, then we may be in for a difficult time.''
   There have been no reports that Gorbachev sent congratulations to
Yeltsin on his election.
   Gorbachev brought Yeltsin to Moscow to head the city's Communist
Party but fired him in 1987 after Yeltsin publicly criticized the
pace of reform. Relations have been strained ever since.
   Yeltsin capped a remarkable political comeback by winning
election Tuesday as Russian president.
   However, at Thursday's session of the Russian Congress, Deputy
Ivan Galushko from the Jewish autonomous region in the Soviet Far
East said Yeltsin was overstepping his authority with some of his
statements the day before.
   He called on Yeltsin ``to refrain from hasty statements on
questions that are within the competence of the Congress or Supreme
Soviet.''
   Tass said many deputies seconded Galushko's opinion.
   In his reply, Yeltsin acknowledged disagreements with Gorbachev
but said he would put them aside.
   ``True, we have our differences,'' said Yeltsin. ``I renounce all
these personal aspects fully and completely. I leave that behind.''
   A deputy of the national Supreme Soviet legislature, Anatoly
Denisov, said in an interview that the differences between Yeltsin
and Gorbachev are so pronounced they portend ``very bad
consequences'' and ``difficult conflicts'' for the nation.
   He said they could lead to the imposition of Soviet presidential
rule nationwide.
