   Russian lawmakers cast ballots Friday night in a
vote to determine whether populist Boris N. Yeltsin would become
president of the Soviet Union's largest republic.
   Yeltsin, a onetime Gorbachev ally ousted two years ago as Moscow
Communist Party chief after calling for faster reform, gained a
double boost Friday. Russian deputies and Soviet media praised a
key campaign speech he made, and the candidate backed by President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev withdrew.
   But Yeltsin, 59, needs backing from 531 of the 1,059 members of
the Russian Congress, more than he himself has estimated he could
count on. Official results from voting late Friday are expected by
Saturday morning.
   The candidate backed by Gorbachev, Russian premier Alexander
Vlasov, withdrew from the race after it became clear he lacked
Yeltsin's popularity.
   Vlasov's departure left Ivan Polozkov, a Communist Party chief
from the southern Russia city of Krasnodar, as Yeltsin's main
rival. The third remaining candidate, aviation instructor Vladimir
Morokin, did not appear to have any chance of winning.
   Russia, by far the largest of the Soviet Union's 15 republics,
comprises more than two-thirds of the country's territory. It is
home to half the Soviet populace.
   A Yeltsin victory would mean an important setback for Gorbachev,
who has clashed repeatedly with his former protege. Gorbachev spoke
out Wednesday against Yeltsin's plan for increased Russian
autonomy, claiming it would mean ``the breakup of the Soviet
Union.''
   Yeltsin, however, pledged Friday that if elected, he would
defend the republic from Moscow interference while not letting
personal conflicts interfere with his Kremlin dealings.
   ``I am for business-like relations, dialogue and negotiations
with the president and the government, but on the principle that
Russia's sovereignty is not damaged,'' Yeltsin told the Russian
Congress. The Russians use the term ``sovereignty'' to mean
increased autonomy _ not secession.
   With his bass voice booming through the hall of the Great
Kremlin Palace, Yeltsin pressed a point-by-point program on
promoting for Russian sovereignty, unleashing market forces,
increasing housing and flooding stores with consumer goods.
   ``Vremya,'' the nightly news program on state-run Soviet
television, gave Yeltsin high marks for his platform. ``Having
heard all the contenders, I can say his program for the rebirth of
Russia came off the best-argued and thought-through,'' the Vremya
report said.
   ``The people believe in Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin,'' deputy
Nina Sivova told the Congress. ``His great force of will is needed
today.''
   In an early indication of Yeltsin's plans if he wins, his speech
blasted the government program announced Thursday for a transition
to a free market economy. He said it had ``already created panic in
the stores today.''
   Instead, he backed an alternative program involving sale of
government property, full independence for enterprises, more
liberal laws on ownership and foreign loans.
   Yeltsin is already a member of the national Congress of People's
Deputies and a member of the Communist Party Central Committee.
   He has made a remarkable political comeback from disgrace two
years ago, when he was ousted from his post as Moscow party chief
and ostracized by the Kremlin elite, including Gorbachev. Yeltsin
has continued to level public blasts of criticism at Gorbachev for
his ``halfway reforms.''
   If no one wins more than 50 percent of the vote in the first
round, the election goes into a runoff between the top two
vote-getters.
