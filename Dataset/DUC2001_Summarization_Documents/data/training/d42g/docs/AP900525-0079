   The candidate backed by Mikhail S. Gorbachev for
president of the Russian republic withdrew from the race today,
strengthening the campaign of Boris N. Yeltsin, the populist who
has repeatedly clashed with Gorbachev.
   The state news agency Tass reported the withrawal of Russian
Premier Aleksandr V. Vlasov but did not give a reason. It said
Vlasov's pullout had been announced at the Congress of the Russian
Federation, which will elect the president, a newly created post in
the largest of the 15 Soviet republics.
   On Wednesday, Gorbachev attacked Yeltsin's platform, accusing
him of calling for the ``breakup of the Soviet Union.''
   The Russian republic contains Moscow and encompasses 11 time
zones, from the Baltic to the Pacific. The Russian language
predominates in the Soviet Union, and much of the nation's wealth,
including vast natural resources, is concentrated in the republic.
   In addition to Yeltsin, two other men remained in the race _
Ivan Polozkov and Vladimir Morokin _ but from the start the
campaign had appeared to be a contest between Yeltsin and Vlasov. A
vote was possible later in the day.
   Prior to Vlasov's announcement, Yeltsin delivered a
well-received speech pledging that if elected, he would defend the
republic from meddling by the national Soviet government, but
refrain from clashing with Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev holds the posts of president of the Soviet Union and
general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, the two most
powerful jobs in the Soviet Union.
   ``I am for businesslike relations, dialogue and negotiations
with the president and the government, but on the principle that
Russia's sovereignty is not damaged,'' Yeltsin told the Russian
Congress.
   His bass voice booming through the hall of the Great Kremlin
Palace, Yeltsin pressed a radical platform for bringing the Russian
republic ``out of crisis.''
   He presented a point-by-point program on how he would fight for
Russian's sovereignty, unleash market forces, increase housing and
flood stores with consumer goods.
   He blasted the government program for a transition to a market
economy presented by Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov on Thursday, saying it
had ``already created panic in the stores today.''
   Instead, he backed an alternative program involving sale of
government property, more liberal laws on ownership and foreign
loans to make the transition without ``everything falling on the
shoulders of the people.''
   Yeltsin already is a member of the Congress of People's
Deputies, which is the national parliament; the Russian Congress of
People's Deputies, the Russian republic's parliament; and the
Communist Party Central Committee.
   During a question-and-answer session, he was asked several times
about his relations with Gorbachev, who entered the hall halfway
through the speech. Yeltsin, formerly Gorbachev's protege, has
become an opponent in the last two years, blaming the Soviet
president for ``halfway reforms.''
   But Yeltsin said their personal relationship would not influence
their interaction as presidents. ``If there was or is something
personal, I'll set it aside,'' he said.
   Yeltsin left the podium to prolonged applause, and was followed
by Ivan Polozkov, a Communist Party chief from Krasnodar who is now
considered Yeltsin's main rival.
   Russia is the largest of the 15 Soviet republics, with just more
than half the country's population and two-thirds of its territory.
