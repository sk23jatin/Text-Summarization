   Populist reformer Boris N. Yeltsin won the
presidency of the largest Soviet republic Tuesday, overcoming
opposition by Mikhail S. Gorbachev and declaring the start of
``Russia's social, economic and spiritual rebirth.''
   Yeltsin's election, after three hard-fought ballots in the
Congress of People's Deputies of the Russian Federation, poses a
substantial challenge to Gorbachev and may spur more radical
reforms across the country.
   Gorbachev, who arrives Wednesday in Washington for a summit,
retains the two most powerful jobs in the country: president of the
Soviet Union and General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party.
   But as president of the largest of 15 Soviet republics, Yeltsin
will have a highly visible platform from which to wage his campaign
for more radical reforms. Yeltsin and other Soviet officials said
they believe his election will help Gorbachev push more radical
reforms.
   ``It may be a blessing in disguise,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman
Gennady Gerasimov told reporters at the United Nations in New York.
``Gorbachev has his critics from both the left and the right, and
possibly it is better to have the election of a critic from the
left.''
   Yeltsin said: ``At first, President Gorbachev will react very
unhappily, but then he'll gradually get used to this
inevitability.''
   The strapping, white-haired Yeltsin told reporters that he would
seek reconciliation with Gorbachev and avoid confrontation with
him, so long as it did not hurt Russia's interests.
   Gorbachev had brought Yeltsin to Moscow to head the city's
Communist Party, but the two men had a falling out in 1987 after
Yeltsin publicly criticized the pace of Kremlin reforms. They have
been at odds since then.
   After the vote result was announced in the Grand Kremlin Palace,
Yeltsin strode to the podium to warm applause and pledged to
``spare nothing _ health or time _ to get out of this crisis and
lead Russia to better times.''
   His bass voice echoing through the hall, he called the day ``the
beginning of the road to Russia's social, economic and spiritual
rebirth, the way out of the crisis and toward the blossoming of
Russia as a sovereign, independent government in the framework of
our union.''
   He left through the Kremlin gates later to the tumultuous cheers
of a small crowd of well-wishers chanting ``Victory! Victory!'' One
man yelled, ``Thank you, thank you for the future!''
   Gorbachev strongly opposed Yeltsin's election. He told the
Russian Congress last week that Yeltsin's platform of moving
political and economic power from central to local authorities
would lead to a ``breakup of the union.''
   The Russian Federation stretches from the Baltic Sea in the west
to the Pacific Ocean in the East. It is home to half the country's
285 million people and includes Moscow, the Soviet capital.
   As president of the Russian Congress, a newly created body that
holds the Russian Federation's highest government authority,
Yeltsin acts as chief executive of the republic and took office
immediately. As the first president of a newly reorganized
legislature, he will play a major role in shaping his powers and
duties, which as yet are unclear.
   After three votes in the 1,060-member Russian Congress, Yeltsin
won 535 votes, four more than the majority needed.
   Russian Premier Alexander Vlasov received 467 votes. Valentin
Tsoy, a little-known businessman from the Soviet Far East, received
11 votes.
   Lawmakers said Tuesday they believed Yeltsin gained the last few
votes he needed by offering to form a coalition government with
members of the conservative Communist Party bloc and other groups.
   Yeltsin said he believed he gained several votes because of a
last-minute push by Gorbachev to block his election. Gorbachev
reportedly urged delegates at a meeting Monday night not to vote
for Yeltsin.
   Russian Deputy Alexander Liubimov, a well-known TV commentator,
said Yeltsin's election would force Gorbachev to start dealing with
another strong leader instead of ``shadows'' willing to defer to
him. ``It will be a lesson for him. Maybe a hard one,'' Liubimov
said.
   Vitaly Churkin, a spokesman for Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze, said on NBC that Yeltsin's election ``might actually
help Gorbachev because Gorbachev is for radical reform, and he
needs more popular support for that.''
   Some also said Yeltsin may have benefited from the adverse
reaction to the Kremlin's proposed program for making the crippled
Soviet economy a partial market economy.
   The reform program, which would triple the price of bread on
July 1 and double the cost of other foodstuffs starting Jan. 1,
caused panic buying that prompted Moscow city authorities to bar
sales to non-residents of the capital Monday.
   The national legislature postponed a decision on the reform plan
Tuesday, raising the possibility of compromise with Yeltsin and
others demanding more radical measures. It also rejected a motion
for a no-confidence vote in Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, who
presented the reforms last week.
   Yeltsin has proposed a more rapid transition to a market-based
economy that would grant more freedom to enterprises and
entrepreneurs.
