<LEADPARA>  Anita Hill took a lie detector test Sunday -- and the polygraph expert who
administered it said she is telling the truth in accusing Clarence Thomas of
sexual harassment.;   Polygraph expert Paul K. Minor told reporters that Hill
did not deceive the Senate Judiciary Committee when she testified Friday that
Thomas had discussed pornographic material and various sex acts with her.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Trying to save her name; Charles Ogletree, a Harvard law professor and one
of Hill's lawyers, said Hill wanted to take the test to refute the attacks
made on her motives and integrity by Republican senators Saturday.;   However,
the significance of polygraph tests is limited. They are not admitted as
evidence in most courtrooms because the scientific community believes they are
insufficiently reliable and judges believe juries give them too much weight.; 
 The danger of polygraph tests is that "some people are able to fool lie
detectors because they believe what they're saying, even though it isn't
true," Georgetown University criminal law professor Paul Rothstein said.;  
What Hill was asked; Minor, a well known polygraph expert who has taught FBI
polygraph operators, said he put four questions to Hill:;   (check) Have you
deliberately lied to me about Clarence Thomas?;   (check) Are you fabricating
the allegation that Clarence Thomas discussed pornographic material with you?;
  (check) Are you lying to me about the various topics that Clarence Thomas
mentioned to you regarding specific sexual acts?;   (check) Are you lying to
me about Clarence Thomas making references to you about the size of his
penis?;   She answered "no" to each question. "There was no indication of
deception to any of the relevant questions," Minor said outside the hearing
room. "It's therefore my opinion Ms. Hill is truthful.";   Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum asked that Hill's polygraph results be placed in the committee
record, but chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., refused, noting that courts did not
accept such evidence and that the test had been produced outside committee
control.;   Nevertheless, Rothstein said, "polygraphs are 60 to 80 percent
reliable, depending upon whom you ask," and Peter Tague, also a Georgetown
criminal law specialist, said that "Prof. Hill's willingness to take a
polygraph test tends to support her credibility.";   The devices purport to
detect untruthful answers by measuring changes in blood pressure, pulse rate
and perspiration.;   While he is considered to be a prominent expert in his
field, Minor's reputation is not without controversy.;   In July 1980, Minor,
who was then with the FBI, administered two polygraph tests to Herman Sillas,
then the U.S. attorney in Sacramento, to determine the veracity of allegations
that he had taken a $7,500 bribe from a prison inmate several years earlier.
The test was later determined to have been improperly administered.;   Minor
could not be reached for comment Sunday.  </TEXT>
