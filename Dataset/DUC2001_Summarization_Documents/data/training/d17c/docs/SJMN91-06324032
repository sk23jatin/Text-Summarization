<CAPTION>  Photos (6), Diagram; PHOTO: How a polygraph test works; In a polygraph exam,
monitors attached to the subject's body measure physical responses to a series
of questions. Tiny pens record physical responses on a sheet of graph paper,
right. The polygraph examiner also notes the subject's other reactions --
fidgeting, pauses, blinking. Examiners say these responses tell whether the
subject is telling the truth or lying. (Color); PHOTO: Photographs by Gary

called the galvanic skin response. (Color); PHOTO: Photographs by Gary Parker

blood pressure. Coiled, flexible tubes like telephone cords wrap around the
subject's chest and stomach. They report each breath. (Color); DIAGRAM: Where
did she lie?; Mercury News reporter Gina Boubion was given a quick polygraph
test by veteran San Jose polygrapher George Harman. She picked a numbered card
at random -- a 5 -- out of a small deck. She didn't tell Harman her card.;
Harman told her to respond "No" to every question. Then he went through the
deck asking her whether each card was hers. Even when he asked her if she
picked the 5, she replied "No."; Harman concluded that she picked the 5
because her galvanic skin response graph, which measured sweat, showed a
reaction. He said other graphs -- respiration and blood pressure -- typically
are not affected in the card test because of the absence of fear and anxiety.
Notations indicate unrelated movements and sighs, marked "M" and "Si."(Color);

<TEXT>     The construction workers on the site where the Oakland hills fire may have
started also took one. They were cleared of suspicion.;   It's a polygraph
test, an examination by that simple machine that supposedly detects the lies
of those who submit to its cold wires and straps.;   Believers in the
polygraph include 2,000 polygraph examiners, plus criminologists, attorneys,
police departments and the CIA.;   They say their tests work because when
people lie, their anxiety and fear of being caught involuntarily cause changes
in their heartbeats and the way they breathe and sweat. Polygraph machines
detect these changes.;   Critics, including psychologists, labor unions and
many judges, say the polygraph is nothing but a crude interrogation tool with
as much credibility as a mood ring. They say it's a mistake to equate fear and
distress with guilt.;   "Wouldn't it be nice if you had a simple test to prove
deception?" said David Lykken, professor of psychology at the University of
Minnesota and a nationally  known polygraph expert. "But we aren't made like
Pinocchio.";   The public usually hears about polygraph tests when somebody
famous takes one, often in situations where it's one person's word against
another. William Kennedy Smith's accuser took the test -- and passed -- to
"prove" she was telling the truth when she said he raped her.;   Ronald Reagan
was fond of polygraph tests. But in 1985, when he would have forced Cabinet
members to take them, Secretary of State George Shultz threatened to resign
and Reagan quietly dropped the idea.;   Pre-employment testing;   The test
gained popularity in the 1970s, when it was used by retail stores and other
private firms to screen job applicants. It lost ground in 1989, when the
federal Employee Polygraph Protection Act took effect, outlawing
pre-employment polygraph testing in most private industry. The act was
endorsed by unions who said the polygraph was an invasion of privacy with
questionable reliability.;   However, the pre-employment polygraph is still
widely used for job applicants in many government offices, including the San
Jose Police Department.;   The credibility of the polygraph is questioned in
criminal courtrooms throughout the country. Twenty-three states allow
polygraph results to be admitted as evidence, but usually only if both sides
agree in advance. California is one.;   Polygraph literally means "many
writings." The instrument measures several body responses -- breathing, blood
pressure and sweat. It was invented in the 1920s by William Moulton Marston, a
lawyer who later went on to create the comic strip "Wonder Woman.";   The
testing procedure begins with a discussion of the test and the allegations.
One purpose of this pre-test interview is to reduce the subject's anxiety and
fear, and take the surprise out of the allegations. Another purpose is to help
the examiner craft questions aimed at eliciting both true statements and lies
as a basis for comparison.;   Not just physiological;   The test is not merely
physiological. Polygraphers can be sly and manipulative in the interest of
producing an accurate test. They rely on complex assumptions about human
nature and criminal psychology, and their subjects are often unaware how
extensively they are being analyzed.;   The polygraph test itself is short --
usually no more than 10 questions. Two to four questions are directly relevant
to the issue at hand -- "Did you steal the $400?";   These questions are mixed
with others that are less relevant but help the examiner analyze the responses
-- "Do you live in California?" or "Have you ever stolen anything in your
life?";   Then the examiner interprets the test and pronounces the subject
truthful or deceptive.;   The examiner also looks for clues to deception --
movement at this question, sweating at that one, a pause or a blink.;   More
'art' than science?;   "Candidly, there's a lot of art that goes into it,"
said Paul Minor, former FBI chief of polygraphs, who tested John DeLorean and
Anita Hill.;   Critics say there's too much art involved and not enough
science.;   "The highly trained examiner is relying on their skill as an
interrogator," said Oakland labor lawyer Brad Seligman, who successfully
opposed pre-employment polygraph tests in 1989 at an electronics store chain.
"The machine is a good prop that the examiner uses to convince people that the
machine knows everything.";   Critics say polygraphers' premises are flawed.
They say it is normal for both guilty and innocent alike to be distressed by
relevant questions.;   "It's a natural reaction to being accused," Leonard
Saxe, a polygraph expert and psychologist at City University of New York. "The
guilty person is going to be afraid of getting caught, while the innocent
person is afraid of being wrongly accused.";   But veteran San Jose
polygrapher George Harman said anxiety and nervousness do not affect his
results.;   "The problem is when you have a person with not enough
nervousness," Harman said. "You can get an inconclusive test result.";  
Pathological liars;   Studies also have been done by polygraphers to prove
that pathological liars and psychopaths have no advantage because both types
know they're lying and neither wants to get caught, said David Raskin, a
polygraph examiner and University of Utah psychologist.;   Polygraph examiners
claim accuracy rates as high as 95 percent. But they admit that the only way
to prove they were right is when a deceptive person later confesses. Guilty
people who pass the test leave undetected.;   Those accuracy claims are
challenged by polygraph opponents, who point to studies done by polygraphers
themselves that say an innocent person has as much as a 50-50 chance of
failing. Other studies show more accurate results for guilty people, saying
they are correctly identified 79 percent of the time or better.;   One of the
most famous accuracy studies cited by polygraph advocates was conducted in
1969 by psychologist Philip Bersh for the U.S. Department of Defense.;   90
percent agreement;   A panel of lawyers reviewed evidence (other than the
polygraph test) against 400 criminal suspects, then concluded whether the
suspects were innocent or guilty. Results were matched against the suspects'
polygraphs, and in 90 percent of the cases, they agreed.;   "There isn't any
single study that resolves the controversy when one wants to know the accuracy
of the polygraph in the real world," said Frank Horvath, president of the
American Polygraph Association and professor of criminology at Michigan State
University at East Lansing.;   Both sides expect the controversy to go on for
as long as it takes science to come up with the perfect lie detector. Some say
it will never happen; others are content that society has come close enough
with the polygraph.;   "Ask yourself, how does the polygraph compare to other
methods we have in our society of determining somebody's guilt or innocence?"
Horvath said. "We all know that innocent people are sometimes convicted and
guilty people frequently walk. The trial process isn't infallible either."  </TEXT>
