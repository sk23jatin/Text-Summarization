   Beginning in December, most private employers
will be barred by law from using polygraphs and other types of lie
detectors to screen job applicants or test the current employees
except in rare circumstances.
   Under new regulations issued Friday by the Labor Department,
employers can be fined up to $10,000 for requiring a job seeker or
employee already on their payrolls to submit to a polygraph exam
for voice stress analysis.
   The regulations, which take effect Dec. 27, implement
legislation passed by Congress and signed by President Reagan last
June outlawing about 85 percent of the current use of lie detector
tests.
   The congressional Office of Technology Assessment had estimated
that 2 million polygraph examinations were conducted last year _ 90
percent of them by private employers.
   Some 7.2 million employers nationwide will be required to put up
posters in December summarizing the prohibitions and exemptions and
outlining the rights of any worker asked to take a lie detector
test.
   Fred Alvarez, assistant labor secretary for employment
standards, said the posters will be mailed out in the next three or
four weeks.
   In addition to the fines, anyone required to take the test in
violation of the new law can sue employers in federal and state
courts for relief, such as employment reinstatement, promotion and
any payment of lost wages and benefits.
   Exempted from protection under the ban are employees of federal,
state and local governments or of federal contractors engaged in
national security, intelligence or top secret activities.
   Also exempted from the ban are prospective employees of armored
car, security alarm and security guard firms hired to protect
operations affecting health and safety, national security or money.
   Pharmaceutical concerns or companies manufacturing, distributing
or dispensing controlled substances also can require job applicants
to submit to a lie detector test, but only for those people who
would have direct access to the drugs.
   Polygraphs still can be used by employers to investigate
specific incidents of theft, embezzlement or sabotage, but not a
persistent problem, such as recurring inventory shortages.
   But any workers asked to submit to a polygraph exam under those
conditions must be given at least 48 hours advance notice and a
statement in advance telling them of their rights, including the
right to refuse the test or to terminate it at any time.
   The pre-test statement also must explain the specific incident
or activity being investigated and the basis for the employer's
suspicion that the person asked to take the exam was involved in it.
   Results of a polygraph test or refusal to submit to such an exam
cannot be used alone as a basis for taking any action against an
employee. The regulations also forbid disclosure of the test
results to anyone other than the employee without the employee's
consent or a court order.
