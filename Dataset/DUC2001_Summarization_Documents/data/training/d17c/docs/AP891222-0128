   A prosecutor calls it ``witchcraft'' and a
psychologist says it's as reliable as a coin toss.
   After years of debate, court rulings and federal legislation,
use of the polygraph has dropped sharply, despite supporters who
insist the test is a good indicator of whether someone is telling a
lie.
   ``They have been useless and give misleading information,'' said
Leonard Saxe, a visiting professor of psychology at Brandeis
University and a leading opponent of polygraph testing. ``They
suggest whether you're guilty or innocent. You might as well flip a
coin.''
   Last week, the state Supreme Court banned lie detector tests
from being introduced as evidence in criminal trials. Massachusetts
had been one of the last remaining states that gave defendants the
right to use polygraphs to support their alibis.
   The court, noting polygraph studies have shown success rates
varying from 95 percent to just above 50 percent, said: ``There
remains no consensus among experts as to the accuracy of polygraph
testing to detect deceit.''
   The court was not alone in deciding against polygraphs, which
attempt to determine someone's honesty by their physiological
response to certain questions.
   Last year, Congress prohibited most private sector employers
from using lie dectectors to screen job applicants or randomly test
workers.
   Exempted from the rules were federal, state and local
governments, firms that do sensitive work for agencies like the CIA
and FBI, companies that provide security services and those that
make or distribute controlled substances.
   ``I think it's appropriate to seek if someone is lying, and the
most appropriate way is to seek evidence,'' said Judy Crockett, who
fought on behalf of the federal law for the American Civil
Liberties Union. ``Polygraphs tend to be an attempt to short-cut
investigations.''
   The federal law, which took effect a year ago, has taken a big
bite out of the polygraph business.
   ``There's been a definite decline in the private sector,'' said
Chris Fausett, product manager for Lafayette Instrument Co., based
in Lafayette, Ind., one of the country's largest makers of
polygraph machines.
   He declined to give specific numbers, but he said the drop was
``about as sharp as you can get.''
   ``No doubt businesses have had to abandon 75-80 percent of
polygraph tests,'' said Joseph Buckley, a spokesman for the
American Polygraph Association, a trade group based in Chattanooga,
Tenn.
   Buckley said his group had about 3,000 members a year ago, but
the number has dropped by a third. ``A lot of them had to change
careers,'' he said.
   However, these trends do not mean polygraph testing is dead.
   Law enforcement agencies use lie detectors to interview
witnesses when investigating crimes.
   The Department of Defense uses polygraph testing to search for
spies, and also to screen job applicants if something suspicious
arises in background checks, said spokesman Jim Turner.
   Reading from a Defense Department statement regarding the use of
polygraphs, Turner said:
   ``In all instances the polygraph exam process produced data of
important security or criminal significance which was not otherwise
obtainable. It was also invaluable in establishing the innocence of
people confronted with serious accusations.''
   Many states allow polygraph evidence to be introduced if both
the prosecution and defense agree.
   New Mexico is the one state where either party can introduce a
polygraph examination as evidence, with the trial judge deciding
whether the tests meet certain standards. But not everyone in the
state supports it.
   Timothy Cornish, a prosecutor in the New Mexico attorney
general's office, called polygraph exams ``witchcraft.''
   ``It can, if used in an unbridled way, change the entire
truth-seeking process,'' he said. ``It replaces the jury.''
   David Raskin, a University of Utah psychologist often called
upon to support polygraphs in the courtroom, said he favored the
federal law because lie detectors were being misused to predict
future performance in the workplace. But he said they are reliable
tools in determining someone's past actions.
   ``Every piece of evidence has a dose of uncertainty,'' Raskin
said. ``Jurors are very cautious with polygraph evidence. They are
overly skeptical. They do not ignore other evidence and concentrate
on the polygraph.''
