   A grand jury's questioning of a polygraph
expert who is helping investigate the bombing of Pan AM Flight 103
indicates the Justice Department's probe is entering a new phase.
   A federal grand jury in Washington heard testimony last Friday
from James Keefe, a polygraph expert for a security consulting firm
hired by lawyers representing Pan Am in a civil suit over the Dec.
21, 1988 bombing.
   Keefe testified about giving polygraph tests to three Pan Am
baggage handlers in Frankfurt, West Germany, during his appearance
before the grand jury, said a source familiar with the case.
   Keefe told the panel two of the three baggage handlers failed
the polygraph tests when they said they knew nothing about the
transfer of a piece of luggage to Flight 103, said the source, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   The source confirmed a report published in Tuesday's editions of
the Syracuse Post Standard.
   Keefe's appearance before the grand jury indicates U.S.
authorities are stepping up their investigation of the bombing over
Lockerbie, Scotland that killed 259 passengers and crew members and
11 people on the ground.
   Anti-terrorism laws give federal prosecutors in Washington
jurisdiction to bring cases in acts that occur abroad.
   Scottish police believe the bomb was in a suitcase that was
placed aboard Pan Am Flight 103 in Frankfurt before it took off for
London. Passengers and luggage were transferred to a Boeing 747 at
London's Heathrow Airport for the trans-Atlantic leg of the trip to
New York City.
   The suitcase is believed to have been brought to Frankfurt
aboard a plane from Malta. Investigators found clothing fragments
in Lockerbie that were traced to a clothing store in Malta,
according to a federal law enforcement source.
   The bombing investigation has focused on a number of terrorist
organizations, including the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command.
   Polygraph tests cannot be admitted in court, but the questions
Keefe asked the baggage handlers and their responses may provide
investigators with new leads in the case.
   Keefe works for Interfor Inc., a New York-based security
consulting firm retained by lawyers representing Pan Am's insurance
carrier in a $300 million damage suit filed by relatives of people
killed in the bombing.
   He was served with the grand jury subpoena on Jan. 25 as he
stepped off a plane at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New
York following his return from Europe, said the source.
