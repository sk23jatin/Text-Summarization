   If you go on a job interview today and are
asked to take a lie detector test, the chances are you would be the
victim of an illegal act.
   The same situation applies if your boss has a polygraph examiner
come into the warehouse tomorrow to hook wires to randomly selected
employees and question them about merchandise missing from the
company's shelves.
   It is now illegal across America for most employers in interstate
commerce to use the controversial polygraph for pre-employment
screening purposes or to use them randomly against workers already
on their payroll.
   These restrictions on lie detectors, whose accuracy has long been
under attack, are enumerated in a federal law that took effect
Tuesday, six months after it was signed by President Reagan.
   ``This is a holiday gift for working people,'' said Judy
Goldberg, legislative representative for the American Civil
Liberties Union.
   ``We expect that the new law will ban 80 percent of the
approximately 2 million polygraph tests given annually,'' Goldberg
said in a prepared statement.
   The law's restrictions will be felt most heavily in 28 states
that lack their own statutes restricting the use of lie detectors,
Goldberg said.
   Not covered by the new rules, however, are federal, state and
local governments and firms doing sensitive work under contract to
the Defense Department, FBI and CIA.
   The only other private-sector exceptions to the general ban apply
to companies that manufacture, distribute or dispense controlled
substances and some types of firms in the security guard, armored
car or security alarm fields.
   The law prohibits an employee from being fired, disciplined or
discriminated against solely for refusing to submit to a polygraph
examination.
   An employer can request an employee to take a lie detector test
if the worker had access to missing or damaged material and if the
employer sets forth in a written statement a reasonable suspicion
that the worker was involved in the loss.
   Any such polygraph exam would have to be conducted under strict
conditions, with no questions about personal beliefs and sexual
behavior, and the exam results alone could not be used as a basis
for discipline or a refusal to hire.
   ``Complaints about polygraph abuse and firings based on polygraph
abuse have been one of the single largest sources of calls to ACLU
offices nationwide,'' Goldberg said.
   ``Now employees can complain to the Department of Labor or go
into court to protect themselves against these inaccurate gadgets,''
Goldberg said.
   She said the law would have the greatest impact in Alabama,
Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana,
Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New
Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio,
Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah,
Virginia and Wyoming.
   Goldberg said employers in the following states, which allow
businesses to request people to take lie detector tests, could be
affected by the new law: California, Hawaii, Idaho, Maryland,
Montana, Nebraska, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
   The remaining 14 states and the District of Columbia have laws
banning polygraph examinations for employment purposes, and these
laws take precedence over the new federal statute if they are more
restrictive, according to Goldberg.
