   A lie detector that measures brain waves would be
more accurate than polygraphs, which measure bodily functions, says
its developer.
   ``It would probably not falsely accuse any innocent people, and
it would probably pick up 70 to 90 percent of guilty people,'' says
J. Peter Rosenfeld, a Northwestern University professor of
psychology and of neurobiology and physiology. ``I think that's
better than existing units.''
   The American Medical Association and the congressional Office of
Technology Assessment have said polygraphs are wrong 15 percent to
50 percent of the time.
   Rosenfeld's lie detector picks up brain-wave activity through
electrodes attached to the scalp, amplifying the signals and
feeding them into a computer, which coordinates the information and
displays it on a video screen.
   ``If sensory information has a special meaning for you ... then
your brain will respond with a special kind of trough called the P3
wave,'' he said.
   In tests at Northwestern, subjects have been asked to look at a
series of words, most with no special meaning. ``Occasionally,
they'll see a word that is meaningful, like some anti-social act
they're involved in _ cheating on tests or using drugs _ which is
sometimes the case here,'' Rosenfeld said.
   ``When they see terms like that, their brain waves break into P3
waves.''
   Polygraphs measure the physical expression of emotions _ pulse,
sweating, blood pressure and breathing, he said.
   Advertising researchers have measured P3 waves to better gauge
what consumers want instead of what they say they want, and
psychiatrists can detect certain disorders, such as attention
deficits, by measuring them, he said.
   Rosenfeld has worked on the detector for almost four years and
says it could be widely used within three more. He published a
study last year and will publish another this summer in the
International Journal of Neuroscience.
   ``It's a perfectly valid way of detecting lies,'' said Sidney
Weinstein, a professor of neurology at New York University College
of Medicine in New York City and editor of the Danbury, Conn.-based
neuroscience journal.
   However, a brain-wave lie detector would probably cost 10 times
as much as the $500 to $600 for a polygraph, and the operator would
need a great deal more training, Weinstein said.
