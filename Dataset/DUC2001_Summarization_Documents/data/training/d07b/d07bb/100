Antarctica has been important on three fronts--geopolitical, future
economic development, but mostly scientific research.  It has been
regulated since 1959 by an international treaty that placed a hold on
the territorial claims of nations, put Antarctica off-limits for
military bases and opened it for scientific research to all.  In 1991
a revised treaty prohibited mining and commercial development for 50
years.  Many believe that without the possibility of economic payback,
funding for research may not continue at current levels.

Antarctica has drawn dramatically increased numbers of tourists and
adventurers.  Environmentalists worldwide want stricter controls on
the scientists and tourists there.  </SUM>
