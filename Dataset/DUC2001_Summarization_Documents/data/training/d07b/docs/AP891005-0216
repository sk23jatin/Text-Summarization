   Antarctica, the last place on Earth where nature
reigns over man, is facing a showdown between those who want to tap
its fabled wealth and those who want it to remain forever untouched
under ice.
   The majestic continent at the bottom of the world, larger than
United States and Mexico combined, is still peopled by scant
thousands who have to import everything but ice cubes.
   Although 16 nations fly flags in Antarctica, and seven claim
slices of it, no one holds title. No one needs a passport. It is a
vast global common, ruled only by the harsh, unforgiving elements.
   But statesmen, scientists and environmentalists must decide soon
whether Antarctica will open up to oilmen and airmen, miners,
commercial fishermen, hotelkeepers and, possibly, colonists.
   In Paris, bginning Monday, 39 nations will review the 1959
Antarctic Treaty that expires in 1991. They also will examine the
remains of the Antarctic Minerals Convention, signed in May 1988.
   The convention would have allowed controlled mining and oil
exploration, replacing a voluntary moratorium. But Australia, one
of seven claimant nations with a veto, decided not to ratify it.
   The United States, the Soviet Union and Japan, among others, are
pressing for a minerals accord. France, echoing Australia's
concerns, wants Antarctica to be an unspoiled world park.
   Delegates were guarded over an eventual compromise. The 1988
convention took six years to negotiate.
   Proponents say a world short of resources has no choice.
Antarctica hoards unknown quantities of gold, platinum and other
strategic metals, along with oil in amounts estimated to be in the
billions of barrels.
   Detractors insist that even controlled exploitation inevitably
pollutes a reserve crucial to man's survival. Upsetting its
delicate balance, they say, will have consequences no one can
predict.
   Undeniably, the world is already muscling in. Penguin livers are
tainted with pesticides and plastics. Century-old garbage litters
pristine panoramas. Antarctica has had its first oil spill.
   ``Trash thrown into the North Sea will eventually settle in
Antarctica,'' the French oceanographer Jacques-Yves Cousteau once
told The Associated Press. ``The world is a closed system.''
   In a more recent interview, he railed against plans to exploit
the last untamed place on earth.
   ``That would be almost criminal, at least stupid,'' he said.
``It would be a catastrophe.''
   Scientists worry that tourists, whose numbers now approach
10,000 a year, endanger fragile ecosystems. Huge ice floes menace
ships' hulls, adding a threat of oil pollution.
   Yet it is the ancient lure of the mysterious continent, largely
unexplored for all of history's daring expeditions, that make it
such a disputed prize.
   Antarctica is 98 percent under ice, but it is no more a white
continent than Africa is a dark one.
   Old ice grows blue, then rich turquoise. As the sun shifts its
angle over floating ice and the glacier beyond, Antarctica is aglow
in pinks and oranges beyond the range of film or canvas.
   Penguin colonies, like rush-hour crowds dressed in black tie,
amuse scientists who try to take them seriously. Seals frolic and
birds move from place to place in turbulent clouds.
   For all the beauty, arguments focus on survival of the planet.
   President Francois Mitterrand of France, making the case for a
world wilderness area, told scientists from 40 countries at a June
meeting: ``It's not just the forests, the prairies or rivers that
are in danger. It's the entire Earth.''
   Specialists regard Antarctica as the world's weather factory.
   For 10 years, scientists there have measured the Earth's
thinning ozone layer, letting through radiation that risks
catastrophic changes in world climate and ocean levels.
   A New Zealand team recently reported the ozone hole over
Antarctica was much more serious than previously believed.
   Cousteau warns that jostling the precarious balance invites
calamity. For example, just scraping the surface of the Earth
spreads dust that alters reflectivity, raising temperatures and
melting ice.
   Human activity disturbs the breeding of unique species of birds
and marine mammals, scientists say. Fishing threatens a delicate
food chain that depends upon plentiful supplies of krill, a tiny
shrimp.
   In Antarctica, with treacherous sea lanes and lashing winds,
accidents are common. Once damage is done, experience shows, it is
very difficult to correct.
