   U.S. tour operators are planning to send a
record 4,000 or more travelers to Antarctica, prompting calls for
strict government regulation to protect penguins, other wildlife
and the very fate of the frozen continent.
   ``The number of tourists visiting Antarctica has more than
tripled in the past five years,'' said Bruce Manheim, a Washington
activist of the Environmental Defense Fund who calls existing
controls inadequate.
   Antarctica has become a ``hot'' travel destination for the
1990s, beckoning older Americans seeking more adventure than Europe
and hoping to see a fragile frontierland visited by only a
privileged few in their youth.
   They are fueling fresh growth in the adventure travel industry,
an estimated $1.3 billion-a-year phenomenon.
   About 800 American tourists traveled to Antarctica in 1988,
3,000 in 1989, and tour operators expect at least 4,000 in the
December-February summer season. Manheim says it could reach 5,000.
   ``There's clearly a trend toward these type of expeditionary
visits to remote places in the world,'' said Manheim.
   He filed an appeal Tuesday with the government urging more
regulation.
   ``We are not trying to prohibit tourists from going to
Antarctica, we just think tourism is something that has to be
regulated carefully,'' he said.
   Concern began mounting after the January 1989 grounding of the
Argentine naval ship Bahia Paraiso in which an estimated 175,000
gallons leaked into marine habitats, killing seals, penguins and
other marine life. The vessel remains at the site off Palmer
Station with some oil in its tanks.
   Particularly worrisome to critics are the plans of Ocean Cruise
Lines of Fort Lauderdale to send the largest cruise ship in years
to Antarctica, the 460-passenger Ocean Princess.
   Rates begin at $3,895 per person for a double-occupancy cabin on
its three wine-and-caviar cruises, which are selling briskly. The
first round trip from Buenos Aires, Argentina, begins Dec. 22.
   Manheim's appeal is urging the government to place strict
controls on helicopter flights near wildlife sites, guidelines on
tourist observation of penguins and seals, and coordination of
cruise ship visits to breeding grounds.
   He said ships had made repeated tourist visits to the same
wildlife sites, disrupting the breeding of seals, penguins and
other birds.
   ``A year after Antarctica's most significant environmental
disaster, we still don't have regulations to prevent similar
catastrophes,'' said Manheim.
   The U.S. government responds that effective regulations are
already in place.
   ``We have tried, and we believed we have dealt succesfully with
the explosion of Antarctica tourism,'' said Jack Talmadge of the
National Science Foundation, which regulates U.S. activities in
Antarctica.
   Talmadge said the NSF has issued tourist regulations,
established a mechanism for assessing fines for violations and
taken steps to limit visits to U.S. research stations.
   He said the tour operators are also cooperating with the NSF to
minimize the impact of tourism, including giving advance notice of
ship visits.
   Although 16 nations fly flags in Antactica and seven claim
slices of it, no nation holds title to the continent, which is
larger than the United States and Mexico combined.
   Military flights and small ships carrying about 100 tourists
have been frequent modes of travel to Antarctica since the first
tourists visited in 1958.
   Now, the Chilean government has opened a spartan hotel at its
Teniente Marsh Station on King George island, and LanChile airlines
began commercial flights to that Antarctic stop last year.
   Australian entrepreneurs have proposed a five-story hotel,
airstrip and hovercraft dock. The Canada-based Adventure Network
currently flies tourists to one South Pole station.
   But the bulk of the tourists are Americans brought in by
U.S.-based operators. Conservationists say the United States should
therefore take the lead in adopting a model regulatory policy.
   ``Antarctica tourism originates almost exclusively in the United
States, and therefore we have the responsibility to regulate our
tourism if we are to push for regulation at an international
level,'' said Manheim.
   Operators of the Ocean Cruise Lines said there is no cause for
alarm.
   ``The tourist visiting Antarctica is a determined
environmentalist, an avid lover of wildlife, and I can assure you
that no tourist _ not one _ has hurt or killed a bird or animal,''
said Lars Eric Lindblad, an Antarctic travel pioneer who will
lecture aboard the Ocean Princess.
   James Barnes, with Friends of the Earth in Washington, concludes
that the travelers may leave their footprints, but they often
return home more committed environmentalists _ ``Ambassadors of
Antarctica.''
   Nonetheless, he said, ``The scale of these activities is growing
at such a pace that it does provide cause for concern.''
