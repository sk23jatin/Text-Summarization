   When the 26 nations with interests in Antarctica recently
agreed to ban mining and oil drilling on the frozen continent
for at least 50 years, environmentalists rejoiced.
   But now scientists and Antarctic administrators think the
pact could backfire. Without any prospect of exploiting the
potential riches hidden beneath the ice, they say, many
nations may conclude Antarctic research isn't worth the
money.

   "Many countries will resign their activities in Antarctica
{because} there is no hope of profits in the near future,"
says Krzyzstof Filcek, a Polish ecologist who studies
Antarctic marine life.
   With the demise of the Soviet Union, the end of the Cold
War and worsening economic problems, former East Bloc
countries are slashing Antarctic research budgets. Four of
nine Soviet research stations, which were strategically
placed around the continent to act as markers for future
claims, have been closed. Poland, noted for Antarctic marine
biology, has managed to staff its Arctowski base with just 14
scientists and workers -- about one-fourth its usual
complement -- and has cut back programs in meteorology and
geology.
   In the U.S., Antarctic budgets have been rising steadily,
mostly to pay for logistics. But the National Science
Foundation, which runs U.S. bases, thinks that the
government's commitment to Antarctica will wane, what with
new restrictions on mineral development and declining Soviet
competition. "We've been living on a tripod-geopolitics,
future uses of Antarctica and research," says Guy Guthridge,
an NSF Antarctic spokesman. "Now two of the three legs have
been taken away from us."
   The U.S. Navy, for instance, regularly pays for about
one-fourth of all oceanographic research, much of it centered
on the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica. But with the
end of the Cold War, the military may cut back because "there
is no enemy," Columbia University oceanographer Arnold Gordon
fears. This year, after a budget battle, more money was
appropriated for U.S. Antarctica research, partly by
redirecting funds earmarked for housing for the poor.
   Such environmentalists as Jacques Cousteau campaigned for
the Antarctic minerals ban so Antarctica could be used as an
environmental laboratory to study the ozone layer, global
warming and pollution. But a major reason the number of
Antarctic research bases doubled to 68 over the past 20 years
had little to do with science. It "was politically inspired,"
says Alfred Fowler, head of the Council of Managers of
National Antarctic Program. Countries "wanted a seat around
the table" if there were mineral riches to divide, he says.
   Proof of a nation's continuing interest in Antarctica is
that it supports scientists there. Nations realized they
needed a base to qualify for membership in the treaty system
that governs Antarctica, which was up for renegotiation this
year.
   During those negotiations, Australia, New Zealand and
France, responding to environmental concerns, blocked an
agreement that would have permitted nations to survey
Antarctica for minerals and oil -- even though the pact would
have set difficult hurdles before development could begin.
Instead, in October, the Antarctic treaty nations approved a
substitute that bars mineral and oil exploration for at least
50 years and requires environmental safeguards for research
bases.
   Critics say the environmental provisions will make science
more expensive in Antarctica, already the costliest research
site apart from outer space. Of the $193 million the U.S.
plans to spend this fiscal year in Antarctica, only $22
million is budgeted for science. The rest is earmarked for
planes, ships and helicopters to ferry researchers; for other
logistics; and for environmental cleanup.
   For many countries, the cost of Antarctic science is
already prohibitive. At Vostok station, famed for its studies
of ice cores that disclose ancient atmospheres, the Soviets
were so strapped for cash that they asked France to pay the
salaries of Soviet workers as part of an international
program. The French refused, say Antarctic scientists, but
agreed to pay for scientific instruments for the Soviets
instead.
   Stanislaw Rakusa-Suszczewski, who runs the Polish
Antarctic program, says he has tried to persuade Hungary and
Czechoslovakia to chip in enough money to make Arctowski a
"post-Communist country" base, but to no avail. "I must look
for another partner," he says. "Maybe Ukraine?"
   The countries with the strongest commitment to Antarctica
may turn out to be the ones that are tied to the continent by
nationalism, not science. Argentina and Chile claim parts of
Antarctica as extensions of their countries, even though the
Antarctic Treaty effectively makes the continent
international territory. They bring families to live in
Antarctica, not just scientists, encourage women to give
birth at their bases and postmark letters there -- all to
back claims of sovereignty.
   `They call them true settlements, not artificial science
bases," says Jack Child, an American University expert on the
region.
