Gun control is an emotional issue in the United States, with wide
political ramifications.

Gun control advocates point to the thousands of deaths due to handguns
annually and federal, state and local officials argue the issue
vehemently.

Lately, many law enforcement officials have come out for tighter
restrictions as have some national and local politicians who fully
recognize the consequences of their stances.

Gun control foes, especially the National Rifle Association, have
great influence with their members; their thumbs-down can kill a
candidate's hopes.  Among those threatened are Senator Dennis
DeConcini of Wyoming and Representative Les AuCoin of Oregon, both of
whom changed sides.  Governor Michael Dukakis, in his presidential
race with George Bush, is another whose past attitudes spell danger.

Mushrooming gun-death statistics have convinced many Americans that
tightened regulations are necessary - many favor federal laws because
of easy state passage. The District of Columbia, with its handgun ban,
is cited.  In 1989, 438 died, and most weapons came from across state
lines.

The NRA argues that the Second Amendment guarantees citizens the right
to arms either for individual protection, or collectively against a
(possible) despotic government.  Their solution: fewer plea bargains,
no parole and more death penalties for criminals.  </SUM>
