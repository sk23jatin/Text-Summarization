<LEADPARA>  FOR 16 years in Congress, I have been a 100 percenter in eyes of the National
Rifle Association leadership. For the past two decades, the entire Oregon
House delegation, regardless of party, has voted with the NRA right down the
line. For a long time, it seemed like the right thing to do.;    It doesn't
any more.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Commentary
Les AuCoin is a Democratic representative from Oregon. He wrote this article
for the Washington Post.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     But out West, politicians are still expected to support NRA leadership. The
conventional wisdom still is: If you cross the gun lobby, they'll have a
silver bullet waiting for you at the next election.;    I'm betting that those
days are over. I will vote for the Brady Bill -- the seven-day waiting period
for persons wanting to buy handguns -- and for restrictions on the sale and
domestic manufacture of assault weapons.;    Don't misunderstand: The NRA has
a strong presence throughout my state. Oregon probably has a lot more pickups
with gun racks than Volvos with ski racks. A landmark I'll never forget in
Newberg, Ore., was a gun store named "Toys for Big Boys." The NRA in Oregon is
62,000 members strong, and there are about 150 gun clubs in the state.;     I
USED to tell myself that gun control isn't crime control and -- comforted by
that thought -- I let my 100 percent NRA rating keep arguments about guns from
consuming the time I felt I needed for the issues I came to Congress to
advance: jobs, education, family security and social justice.;    What has
been happening in our streets has changed my mind dramatically. Handguns alone
have killed about 50,000 people in the United States since the Brady Bill was
last considered by Congress. Oregonians in "safe" neighborhoods face gun
violence unthinkable when I was first elected to Congress in 1974.;    Youth
gangs with bulging arsenals cruise up and down Interstate 5 on the West Coast
to ply their drug trade in our cities. Just a few weeks ago, a gang knocked
over a gun shop in rural Hood River to steal sophisticated firearms, including
assault weapons, apparently intended for sale on the black market. One youth
was shot to death during the crime.;    The '80s shattered Oregonians' dearly
held image of their state as an island in a sea of national crime and
violence. When a gunman with a long criminal history blew away five children
in a Stockton, Calif., schoolyard two years ago, Oregonians were appalled to
discover he'd bought his assault rifle in Sandy, Ore. Even Oregon gun
lobbyists privately conceded our state's problems with criminal and negligent
use of firearms.;     AS CRIME got worse, I discovered what an ideological
straitjacket that NRA seal of approval can be. If New Jersey's mandatory
background check for handgun purchases has caught 10,000 convicted felons
trying to buy handguns, how could I honestly tell myself that gun control
isn't crime control?;    If, as the nation just learned last week, more
teen-age boys now die from gunshot wounds than from all natural causes
combined, how could I continue to separate neatly the increasing carnage in
communities from "my issues" of jobs, education, social justice and family
security? I couldn't.;    A couple of years ago, after listening to my own
anti-gun-control spiel one time too many, I realized how threadbare it
sounded. I started paying closer attention to the arguments on both sides of
the Brady Bill and assault weapon curbs.;    I lent an ear to some unexpected
gun control advocates: a janitor who accosted me angrily after a teachers'
meeting in Beaverton; Newberg's police chief, who is also an NRA member; and
my own wife, who grew up -- as I did -- in rural Redmond, where some are fond
of saying you learn to shoot before you learn to read.;    I used to think I
listened; now I've heard. What I've heard convinces me that the conventional
wisdom about the NRA's clout is hopelessly out of touch -- and that the
leaders of the NRA are out of touch too. Most of the people I represent are
now more concerned about gun violence than they are about whatever
inconvenience may be caused by a seven-day waiting period, which can prevent
felons, drug addicts and the mentally disturbed from buying handguns.;    The
Brady bill and assault weapon curbs aren't panaceas for crime, but evidence at
the state level shows they will help.;     MY CONSTITUENTS want policies that
reduce violent crime, regardless of whether they are labeled "gun control."
The gun lobby guarantees its political irrelevance by denying that. By
opposing moderate measures like the Brady Bill -- which public opinion
research shows 87 percent of gun owners favor -- the leadership of the NRA has
made its congressional supporters patsies in a game of lethal consequences.;  
 This time, the gun lobby has overplayed its hand. Frankly, I'm sick of it,
and I'm sick of gun violence.;    After too long at the table, I'm ready to do
what I can to bust up the game.  </TEXT>
