   Michael Dukakis' long-time support for tighter
government controls on handguns provided ample ammunition for George
Bush and the National Rifle Asociation.
   Dukakis, who supports a federal seven-day waiting period on
handgun purchases and a ban on ``Saturday Night Specials,'' accused
his opponent of distorting his stance on gun control.
   ``I've always supported the right of hunters and sportsmen to own
weapons and (for) people to protect themselves in their own homes,''
the Democrat said.
   Dukakis backed the so-called Brady amendment to impose a uniform,
mandatory seven-day waiting period on handgun purchases in all
states. Bush opposed the Brady amendment, which went down to a
228-182 defeat Sept. 13 after intense lobbying by the NRA.
   Bush, a lifetime member of the NRA, elicited cheers from crowds
across the South and West whenever he declared his opposition to new
federal gun controls.
   ``I'm a sportsman, I'm a hunter, (I) like to do it, and I don't
believe we need the federal government going forward with gun
control legislation,'' Bush told a rally in Billings, Mont.
   In opposing a federal waiting period, Bush found himself on the
opposite side of several national police organizations, worried
about the vagaries of state laws. Only 22 states now bar instant gun
purchases.
   Dukakis vehemently denied ever telling a gun owners' lobbyist,
``I don't believe in people owning guns, only the police and
military. And I am going to do everything I can to disarm this
state.''
   In 1976, Dukakis supported a Massachusetts referendum to ban
private ownership of handguns. The referendum failed.
   Dukakis currently favors the ban on Saturday Night Specials, as
well as ``additional efforts to keep guns out of the hands of the
criminally or mentally dangerous, including background checks.''
   Dukakis boasts that as governor he supported a law setting a
mandatory one-year prison sentence for those illegally carrying a
gun, and stiffened penalties for felonies commited with a firearm.
He says 22,000 Americans are killed each year with handguns.
   At one point the Dukakis campaign threatened a lawsuit against
the NRA over ads berating the Democrat's record on guns and crime.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, long a favorite of the NRA, came to
the defense of his running mate, saying, ``I saw those ads about
Mike Dukakis going to take the guns away from you. I sure wouldn't
be running with any fellow if I thought he was going to take my
shotgun away from me.''
   Bush said he supports ``mandatory sentences for those caught
using a gun during a crime.'' But in a letter to the NRA, the
Republican attacked what he called the ``gun control myths.''
   ``Those who invent these myths threaten more than the rights of
our 70 million gun owners and 25 million hunters,'' Bush said.
``Federal licensing, gun registration, background checks, or a ban
on firearms to name a few, would only restrict the rights of the
law-abiding, leaving criminals free to commit crimes with illegal
weapons.''
   Dukakis told a crowd in Pueblo, Colo., that the charges he is
against gun ownership are ``a lot of baloney.''
   ``What I'm concerned about is teen-agers in major cities of this
country running around with Uzis and AK-47s (automatic military
weapons) and killing people'' in street gangs and drug deals,
Dukakis said. ``That's the kind of thing that's got to be
controlled, not innocent sportsmen who have a perfect right to
hunt.''
   Bush, as a congressman from Houston, voted for the original
federal Gun Control Act of 1968. That law, enacted after the
assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., barred convicted
felons from buying or owning guns and banned interstate and
mail-order sale of handguns.
   But Bush says he also supported the 1986 McClure-Volkmer Act that
allowed the interstate sale of rifles and shotguns.
   Bush, in his campaign literature, says, ``I have always opposed
federal gun registration or licensing of gun owners.'' But he added,
``We must balance the legitimate interests of gun owners with the
rights of society. ... We must do all we can to keep guns out of the
hands of convicted criminals.''
   In a debate with other Republican candidates before the Gun
Owners of New Hampshire last Feb. 2, Bush said, ``I'm not only a
hunter but I'm a lifetime member of the NRA. I do have a deep
appreciation for the Second Amendment rights'' to keep and bear arms.
