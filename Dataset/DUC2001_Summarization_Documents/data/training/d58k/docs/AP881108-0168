   Anti-gun control groups and some U.S. law
enforcement officials are questioning the validity of a study that
says the Canadian city of Vancouver is safer than Seattle because of
gun control laws.
   A study to be published Thursday in the New England Journal of
Medicine concludes that the number of handgun deaths in Vancouver,
British Columbia, 120 miles to the north, between 1980 and 1986 was
nearly one-fifth that of Seattle.
   Dr. John Henry Sloan, chief investigator for the study, said 388
homicides occurred in Seattle during the study period, while 204
occurred in Vancouver. The number of gun-related deaths in Seattle
was 139, compared with 25 for Vancouver, he said.
   Sloan, 34, a researcher at the Injury Prevention Research Center
at Seattle's Harborview Medical Center, stopped short Tuesday of
saying his findings prove Seattle's laxer handgun control laws cause
more deaths, but said ``it virtually explains it.''
   Gun control activists were quick to seize the opportunity.
   ``I think that the study clearly puts to rest the notion strong
handgun control laws don't have an effect on levels of crime,'' said
Susan Whitmore, spokeswoman for Washington, D.C.,-based Handgun
Control Inc.
   John Hosford, executive director of the Seattle-based Citizen's
Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, dismissed the study
as a political ploy to help a gun control initiative on Maryland's
ballot.
   ``It's not new research,'' Hosford said. ``I don't think the
study is valid, since it doesn't take into account the cause and
effect of many issues.''
   And Dr. Paul Blackman, spokesman for the National Rifle
Association in Washington, D.C., criticized the study for not
looking at the period before Vancouver's new gun control laws went
into effect in 1978.
   Sloan said Vancouver's laws were made stricter in 1978, but
didn't change significantly.
   In Seattle, handguns may legally be purchased for self defense.
After a 30-day waiting period, a permit can be obtained to carry a
handgun as a concealed weapon. Recreational uses are minimally
restricted.
   In Vancouver, self-defense is not considered a legal reason to
purchase a handgun. Concealed weapons are not permitted and
recreational use of handguns such as target shooting and collecting
are regulated by the province. The weapons may only be fired at a
licensed shooting club.
   In addition, criminal offenses carry stricter penalties than in
the United States, said Vancouver police Sgt. Robert Law.
   Hosford said that what Seattle needs is not more gun control
laws, but stricter penalties for people convicted of crimes
involving guns.
   Jim Deschane, commander of the Seattle police West Precinct, said
he believes the process of allowing people to carry handguns in the
city is ``far too lax'' because police can't check applicants'
medical records.
   Dr. Stanley Abrams, a forensic psychologist who has been involved
in investigations of serial murders in Portland, Ore., said easy
availablity of guns can cause more deaths, because it is
psychologically more difficult for someone to use a knife to kill
than to just shoot a gun.
   ``People who use knives have to be more destructive _ it's
definitely more difficult to kill with a knife,'' Abrams said.
   And since only 5 percent of murders are planned, a person
carrying a gun makes it that much more likely a murder will occur,
Abrams said.
