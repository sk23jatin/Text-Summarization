<HEAD>Loss of Interferon Genes Linked with Leukemia</HEAD>

   A form of blood cancer that strikes children
appears to be sometimes linked with genetic damage that hinders the
body's ability to make interferon, according to a study published
today.
   The researchers speculate that genes that oversee the body's
production of interferon, a disease-fighting substance, may play a
role in warding off the development of cancer.
   The researchers speculate that the interferon genes may act as
regulators that stop the body's cells from becoming cancerous.
   The researchers, based at the University of Chicago, found an
association between loss of the genes and development of acute
lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common form of childhood leukemia.
   They tested 62 patients with this kind of leukemia and found
that 29 percent of them were missing the interferon genes.
   Their work, directed by Dr. Manuel O. Diaz, was published in the
New England Journal of Medicine. It adds to the growing list of
cancers that have been associated with the presence or absence of
particular genes.
   Some genes, known oncogenes, are though to trigger cancer.
Cancer can also occur when other genes, known as anti-oncogenes,
are missing.
   Interferon plays a variety of roles in regulating the body's
immune defenses and controlling cell growth.
   The production of two forms of interferon, known as alpha and
beta-1, are controlled by two genes that are close together on
chromosome 9 in the body's library of genes.
   In the latest work, the researchers found that this section of
the chromosome was frequently missing in those with acute
lymphoblastic leukemia. However, they left open the possibility
that some other gene in this region besides those that make
interferon could also be the tumor-suppressing gene.
   Acute lymphoblastic leukemia accounts for about one-quarter of
all childhood cancers. It strikes one in every 30,000 children.
