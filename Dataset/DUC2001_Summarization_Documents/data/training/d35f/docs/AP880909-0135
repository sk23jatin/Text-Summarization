   The death rate from leukemia was nearly 60 percent
higher among smokers of more than 10 cigarettes a day than among
non-smokers, according to a study published Friday.
   While no direct link has been established between smoking and
leukemia, research published in the British Medical Journal showed
that the leukemia death rate among people who smoked fewer than 10
cigarettes a day was 34 percent higher than among non-smokers.
   For smokers of 10 to 20 cigarettes a day it was 57 percent, and
for smokers of 21 or more cigarettes 63 percent, the study showed.
   ``If the findings in our study represented a direct relationship
between smoking and leukemia, then it must follow that smoking is
responsible for more cases of leukemia than all the hitherto
established causes combined,'' said Dr. Leo Kinlen, director of the
Cancer Epidemiology Unit at the University of Edinburgh.
   Kinlen conducted the study of 248,000 U.S. military veterans
with E. Rogot, a statistician at the National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda,
Maryland.
   They wrote that it was ``the largest study of leukemia and
smoking habits to date (and) represents additional evidence that
leukemia is a smoking-related disease.''
   In an editorial in the prestigious weekly, Professor Nicholas
Wald of St. Bartholemew's Hospital in London cautioned that no
cause-and-effect relationship had been established.
   But he added: ``Whatever the mechanism, the balance of evidence
suggests that smoking may cause leukemia.''
   It should therefore be added to the World Heath Organization's
list of tobacco-related causes of death, he wrote.
   The study was conducted on data collected from 248,000 veterans
between 1954 and 1969, the researchers wrote. During that period
723 died of leukemia. Of these 330 were cigarette smokers, 185 were
ex-smokers, 46 smoked cigars or and 162 were non-smokers.
   The study found that in some types of leukemia, the death rate
among smokers was sharply higher than the average.
   Thus for monocytic and myeloid leukemias, the rate among smokers
of more than 20 cigarettes a day was 93 percent higher, compared
with 48 percent for lymphatic leukemias.
   For smokers of 10 to 20 cigarettes a day the rate of death from
lymphatic leukemia was 76 percent higher, and for one to 10
cigarettes, 40 percent higher.
   When the data was broken down into smokers and ex-smokers, it
suggested that ex-smokers also are significantly more at risk. The
death rate among smokers was 53 percent higher, and among
ex-smokers 39 percent.
