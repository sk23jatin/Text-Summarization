   An experimental cancer drug that works after a
single round of treatment appears to be the most effective medicine
yet for a rare form of leukemia, according to a study.
   The drug _ called 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, or 2-CdA _ has
produced complete remissions in almost all hairy cell leukemia
patients treated, and none has relapsed so far.
   Researchers who developed and tested the medicine report that it
``may well be the drug of choice in the treatment of hairy cell
leukemia.''
   The drug also has been used successfully against chronic
lymphocytic leukemia. It, like hairy cell leukemia, is a cancer of
the white blood cells, which produce disease-fighting antibodies.
   The latest study, published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine, was directed by Dr. Lawrence D. Piro of the Scripps
Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla, Calif. Scripps recently
made an agreement with Johnson &amp; Johnson's Ortho Pharmaceuticals to
produce and distribute the drug once it's approved by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration.
   In the published work, doctors gave the drug to 12 patients as
far back as four years ago. In 11, the disease disappeared and they
remain disease free.
   In all, the Scripps doctors have treated 24 patients with almost
complete success. However, they caution that longer follow up will
be necessary before they can be sure they have actually cured the
disease.
   Two other treatments for hairy cell leukemia have been developed
in recent years. They are interferon and deoxycoformycin, a drug
that is similar to 2-CdA. However, interferon is less effective,
and both of those treatments produce serious side effects.
   By contrast, the only unwanted effect of 2-CdA was a few days of
fever. Patients experienced no nausea, hair loss, rashes or other
symptoms typical of cancer therapy. Also unlike other treatments,
this one appears to work after a single seven-day course of therapy.
