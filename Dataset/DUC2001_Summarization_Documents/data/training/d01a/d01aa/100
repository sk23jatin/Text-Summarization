President Bush's nomination of black conservative Clarence Thomas to
replace the Supreme Court's first black Justice, liberal Thurgood
Marshall, split the Senate down the middle. Thomas's opposition to
affirmative action alienated civil rights activists while his Catholic
upbringing and interest in the priesthood raised alarm in
abortion-rights groups.  The Judiciary Committee deadlocked 7-7 and
the nomination was referred to the Senate without recommendation after
extended televised hearings on charges of sexual harassment against
the nominee. Thomas was confirmed by a close 52-48 vote but he
commented that nothing could give him back his good name.  </SUM>
