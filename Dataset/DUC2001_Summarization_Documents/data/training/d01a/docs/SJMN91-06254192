<LEADPARA>  Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas went before the Senate Judiciary
Committee today, and leading Democrats said they would use his confirmation
hearings to question whether he favors a "radical change" in American law --
including a ban on abortions.;   Thomas sat quietly in a packed committee
room, his family nearby, as Sen. Joseph Biden pledged "open and fair"
hearings. But Biden, D-Del., wasted little time in getting to a topic expected
to consume much of the hearings -- Thomas' belief in "natural law," a legal
theory that some individual rights are inherent and independent of all
government authority.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Sen. Strom Thurmond, the panel's senior Republican, said Thomas' rulings as
an appeals court judge were "within the mainstream" and warned his Democratic
colleagues about inappropriate questions.;   "Requiring a nominee to pass an
ideological 'litmus test' would seriously jeopardize the efficacy and
independence of the federal judiciary," Thurmond said.;   But Sen. Herb Kohl,
D-Wis., told Thomas, "We'll want to know what you really think . . . Don't
hide behind the argument that you can't discuss the issues.";   Thus was the
stage set for what is expected to be a lively set of hearings for Thomas, a
black conservative nominated to replace retiring Justice Thurgood Marshall,
the nation's first black justice.;   After each of the committee members gave
an opening statement, the proceedings were stopped for a 90-minute lunch
break. Thomas was to begin his testifying later in the afternoon.;   Even
before Biden rapped the opening gavel, Thomas' nomination triggered a
confirmation battle more akin to a political campaign -- television
commercials, endorsements by dozens of groups for and against, and a daily
drumbeat of support from President Bush.;   Abortion aside, Thomas also is
expected to be questioned about his views on civil rights -- especially
affirmative action -- and the right of privacy.;   Thomas smiled broadly as he
shook hands with Biden and other members of the committee in advance of the
opening gavel.;   Moment of humor; For the most part, he sat quietly at the
witness table while members of the committee outlined their views on his
nomination.;   There was a moment of humor when Biden asked Thomas how old he
was. Thomas, 43, replied, "well, I've aged over the last 10 weeks" since his
nomination.;   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said that while Thomas has
never commented publicly on abortion directly, the nominee once praised a
speech that called abortion "the constitutional equivalent of murder.";   But
Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a strong Thomas supporter, said Thomas should not be
forced to spell out his views on abortion because Justice David H. Souter, who
won Senate confirmation last year, was not required to do so.;   Questioned on
'natural law';   Biden said Thomas would be asked about his belief in "natural
law." Some critics contend Thomas holds natural-law views that could lead to
the conclusion that fetuses have a "right to life" requiring states to outlaw
all abortions.;   Biden himself is an advocate of natural law in some form,
but he said Thomas apparently holds "a vision of natural law that we have
moved beyond.";   Biden said he would be looking closely to see whether
Thomas' philosophy would lead to imposition of a moral code on the
Constitution and "radical change" in legal opinion.;   Thurmond, of South
Carolina, said Thomas has all it takes to become "an outstanding member of the
Supreme Court.";   "It is not appropriate that philosophy alone should bar a
nominee from the Supreme Court unless that nominee holds a belief that is
contrary to the fundamental, longstanding principles of our nation," Thurmond
said in prepared comments.;   In prepared opening remarks that reflected
Democrats' ambiguity about Thomas, Sen. Patrick V. Leahy, D-Vt., said, "I am
impressed -- and the country is -- by the less-traveled road you have taken
from Pinpoint, Ga., to the threshold of the Supreme Court. Your
self-discipline, diligence and hard work are exemplary.;   "But at the same
time, your record and your writings trouble me," Leahy said. "I have no clear
idea of your approach to the Constitution.";   "I am also troubled by your
open admiration for those who are willing to deceive and defy Congress and by
the hostility you have demonstrated toward Congress both in action and in
word," Leahy said.;   As the hearings opened, the White House expressed
confidence today that the Senate would confirm Thomas.;   "It's just beginning
up there; it's just beginning," Bush said when asked if Thomas' confirmation
was assured.;   "People know of my total support for him and I think he'll do
very well. But now it's in the hands of the Senate. Let them make this
determination," Bush said.;   'Independence of the court'; Making a fresh
appeal for Thomas on the eve of today's opening hearing, Bush exhorted
lawmakers Monday to "preserve the independence of the court" by avoiding
asking the nominee how he would vote.;   But one member of the committee, Sen.
Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said on NBC-TV today: "I think we have a right to
find out from him exactly what's going through his head on a number of issues.
And I think to do less than that would be irresponsible on our part.";   White
House spokesman Judy Smith said today that, although the White House would not
divulge numbers in an informal head count, "We're confident Judge Thomas will
be confirmed.";   If confirmed, Thomas would be the 106th Supreme Court
justice but only the second black.;   The committee is expected to closely
examine Thomas' record as chairman of the federal Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission and as head of the Education Department's civil rights office.
Liberals contend he pursued policies that slowed, or even blocked, increased
opportunities for minorities and women.;   Feminist groups have been in the
forefront of the liberal coalition opposing Thomas, warning that his vote
added to an already conservative Supreme Court could overturn federal
protection for abortion rights and send the issue back to state legislatures.
The National Abortion Rights Action League aims to flood Senate offices with
half a million anti-Thomas post cards.  </TEXT>
