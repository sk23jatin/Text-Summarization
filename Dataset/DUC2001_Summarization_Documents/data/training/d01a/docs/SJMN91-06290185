<LEADPARA>  Clarence Thomas, triumphing over eleventh-hour charges of sexual harassment,
won Senate confirmation by only four votes Tuesday night to become the
youngest member of the Supreme Court and its first black conservative.;   The
52-48 vote -- the narrowest for any confirmed high court justice in more than
a century -- culminated one of the most inflammatory and unusual Supreme Court
confirmation fights in U.S. history.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Thomas is expected to join the high court as its 106th justice next week,
becoming the seventh conservative on a nine-member court already embarked on a
counterrevolution against many liberal rulings of the past.;   Eleven
Democrats joined 41 Republicans to produce the slim majority in favor of the
43-year-old federal appeals judge.;   It was the closest Senate confirmation
of a Supreme Court nominee since Lucius Q.C. Lamar, an appointee of President
Grover Cleveland, also squeezed through by four votes in 1888. Lamar was
confirmed on a 32-28 vote.;   President Bush, elated by the approval of his
nominee, called Thomas to congratulate him. "You did a fine job," Bush said.
"You were a wonderful inspiration and you had the overwhelming support of the
American people. You have a lifetime of service to your country ahead. Well
done.";   In a statement issued by the White House, Bush referred to Thomas as
"a man of principle who is sensitive to the problems and opportunities facing
all Americans.";   But feminists were outraged. "Today the Senate sacrificed
the integrity of the Supreme Court, its own reputation and the rights of
American women to the Bush-Reagan agenda," the Women's Legal Defense Fund said
in a statement released after the vote.;   Thomas said he wanted to put his
confirmation ordeal, which lasted more than three months, behind him.;   "This
is more a time for healing, not a time for anger or for animus or animosity,"
he told reporters in a brief interview outside his Virginia home.;   "I guess
in so many ways, as I say to my wife so many times, I'd like to thank
America," he said.;   In Norman, Okla., the woman whose complaints prompted
the extraordinary weekend hearings on sexual harassment allegations against
Thomas said she hoped his confirmation wouldn't stop others from complaining
about harassment in the workplace.;   Law Professor Anita Hill, once an aide
to Thomas, declined to comment specifically about the Senate vote. But, she
said, if she had it to do again, she still would have testified against
Thomas.;   "My gut reaction is that it was the right thing to do . . . and
even looking at how hard it was, I would do it again because it was the right
thing," she said.;   If Thomas is sworn in, as expected, on Monday, he will
have missed oral arguments in 20 cases, including high-visibility disputes
over school desegregation and abortion. He will not participate in these cases
unless the other justices anticipate a tie vote and order new arguments.;  
The Senate vote followed a 7-7 Senate Judiciary Committee deadlock over the
nomination and committee hearings of unprecedented range, from discussions of
lofty constitutional principles to accounts of lurid sexual misconduct.;  
Under oath, Hill accused Thomas of misusing his position as her boss at the
Department of Education and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission by
sexually harassing her a decade ago. Thomas vehemently denied that the events
Hill described ever took place.;   Left unresolved was the central question of
whether Hill was telling the truth last weekend on the sexual harassment
issue. With that issue undecided, Thomas backers argued that he was entitled
to a presumption of innocence and a number of Democrats agreed.;   "Professor
Hill's allegations cannot be used to justify a vote against Judge Thomas,"
Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., concluded in casting his ballot for Thomas.;   The
hearings on the harassment charges led only four previously pro-Thomas
Democrats to change their minds and vote against him: Richard Bryan and Harry
Reid of Nevada, Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut and Bob Graham of Florida.;  
Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said Thomas was "a decent human being" who was
wronged "because of a process that broke down . . . and his life, though not
ruined by any stretch of the imagination, has been severely harmed.";  
Disagreeing, Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said: "To give the benefit of the
doubt to Judge Thomas is to say that Judge Thomas is more important than the
Supreme Court.";   Thomas' defiant and powerful response to the charges was,
to many observers, a critical turning point in the hearings.;   He refused to
tolerate any further inquiries into his private life and portrayed himself as
an innocent victim of "a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks" and "the most
bigoted, racist stereotypes" of the sexual prowess of black men.;   But
several senators deplored the injection of race into the Thomas nomination.;  
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who opposed the nomination, blamed the
administration.;   "I'm saddened that once again race was used as a tool for
short-term political gain," Leahy said.;   Thomas will succeed retired Justice
Thurgood Marshall, the first black justice and the Supreme Court's last link
to the liberal Warren Court of the 1950s and 1960s.;   As the youngest Supreme
Court justice, Thomas is expected to remain on the high court for decades,
long enough to grapple with anticipated 21st-century legal issues stemming
from new reproductive technologies, gay and lesbian claims to family rights,
experimental drugs, multinational business arrangements and other
developments.; How they voted; Here is the 52-48 roll call by which the Senate
