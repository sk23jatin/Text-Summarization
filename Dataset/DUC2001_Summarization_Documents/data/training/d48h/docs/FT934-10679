techniques are making it easier to predict eruptions

Volcanoes, which spit ash, ooze lava and create darkness in the middle of
the day, are impressive displays of nature's restlessness. They are also
life-threatening: more than 28,500 people died from eruptions during the
1980s. They can cause millions of dollars in property damage and bring
industrial activity to a grinding halt.
New technology to improve the accuracy of eruption forecasts is helping to
minimise the devastation volcanoes can cause. After the Nevado del Ruiz
eruption killed nearly 25,000 people in Colombia in 1986, the US government
began taking volcanic forecasting seriously. The US Geological Survey, which
tracks volcanic activity around the world, was infused with new funds to
create a detailed database and update its techniques.
The new technology will not only help to save thousands of lives, it may
also save millions of dollars. According to the Aviation Safety Journal,
more than 60 aircraft have been damaged by drifting clouds of volcanic ash
since 1980. The repair of a 747 aircraft damaged during the 1989 eruption
from Redoubt Volcano in Alaska cost Dollars 80m (Pounds 53m).
The continuous eruption of Hawaii's Kilauea since 1983 has caused more than
Dollars 5m in damage, much of it to properties and crops affected by the
acid-bearing volcanic pollutants. Mount St Helens in Washington state wiped
out thousands of acres of productive timberland.
Losses from interrupted economic activity are harder to quantify, but may be
more devastating. Redoubt's eruption, for instance, caused a valuable oil
storage terminal to close for several weeks and halted most flights into and
out of the region.
Tourism often takes the hardest hit of all. When US geologists issued
eruption warnings in California's Long Valley in 1982, the resort area
turned into a ghost town almost overnight. And the tourist-based economy of
Guadeloupe neared collapse in 1976 after an international group of
volcanologists forecast the eruption of La Soufriere.
The Long Valley and Guadeloupe incidents are tinged with bitterness since
the predicted disasters never happened. Guadeloupe evacuated 72,000 people
and tourists stayed away. Yet the only crisis that hit the Caribbean island
was in the economic sphere.
Scientists blame these fiascos on insufficient data. 'The identification of
fresh volcanic glass in the erupted ash - which seemed to indicate that the
volcano was about to erupt violently - was a mistake,' wrote Richard Fiske,
a volcanologist at the Smithsonian Institution, about the incident.
Volcanologists today use more sophisticated techniques. Detailed databases
are maintained on all life-threatening volcanoes around the world.
High-frequency monitors to measure debris flows are now in place.
Earthquakes - often the first warning of volcanic activity - are tracked
with increasing accuracy. And changes in gas composition, electrical
conductivity and other clues are carefully monitored.
As a result, volcanic activity can now be forecast with substantial
accuracy, often pinpointing the eruption to within days or even hours of its
actual occurrence. When Redoubt erupted in Alaska in 1989 and Pinatubo blew
its top in the Philippines in 1991, volcanologists provided important
information, not only about the timing of the events, but also about the
direction of debris flows and ash blooms - vast clouds formed when tiny
pieces of lava or rock are thrown into the air.
'We used information on the ash blooms (during the Redoubt eruption) to know
which areas to stay away from, and which were safe to fly through,' says
Greg Witter, a spokesman for Alaska Air.
Companies can also take advantage of eruption forecasts to move valuable
equipment out of the way, and evacuate employees from the area.
'Businesses with sensitive electronics may want to shut down their air
filtration system during an ash bloom,' says Steven Brantley, public
information scientist with the US Geological Survey. Since ash blooms often
drift for many miles, they can wreak havoc on property well beyond the
life-threatening zone of eruption.
Volcanology can also be used for future planning. After much of its timber
was wiped out during the eruption of Mount St Helens, the paper group
Weyerhaeuser consulted experts to decide which areas should be replanted and
which avoided as too high-risk.
Not all businesses welcome the interference of volcanologists, however. In
Long Valley developers have refused to heed warnings in land use planning.
'We've had mixed results, because we can't force people to follow our
advice,' says Daniel Miller, a geologist with the US Geological Survey.
'We've had a very negative and unpleasant response from businesses in Long
Valley. They just don't believe that they might be in a risk zone and insist
on building things anywhere they please.'
Developers in the region complain that the volcanologists' warnings have
resulted in higher insurance rates, limited areas of potential development
and stoked the fears of tourists.
The relationship between active volcanoes and the communities that surround
them is not always confrontational. Kilauea has become a leading Hawaiian
tourist attraction. It is considered the ideal volcano. Because the eruption
is continuous, it is seldom life-threatening and ash blooms are rare.
Instead, the volcano throws up a scenic display of colourful lava, which
attracts hikers by day and creates a natural light show at night.
Scientists have gleaned much useful information from the decade-long
eruption.
'The resorts look to us to provide information on best viewing times, which
they pass on to the tourists,' says David Clague, scientist in charge of the
Hawaii Volcano Observatory at Kilauea. 'It's generally pretty tame as far as
volcano eruptions go, but it's spectacular at night because it's
iridescent.'
