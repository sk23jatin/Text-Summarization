<LEADPARA>  Thanks to the eruption of Mount Pinatubo, "once in a blue moon" is now.;   
Volcanic dust and gases, lofted into the stratosphere last month by the
Philippine volcano's cataclysmic eruption, have spread all the way around the
Earth in a wide band along the equator. Within a few months, the plume should
spread to cover the entire Northern Hemisphere, perhaps causing a measurable
cooling in climate.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In tropical regions, said atmospheric scientist Brian Toon, "green suns and
blue moons are probably being seen now" because of the volcanic plume being
carried by stratospheric winds.;    In the fall, throughout the Northern
Hemisphere, "it will be extremely obvious to the ordinary person. At sunrise
and sunset, the horizon will have a glowing purplish color.";    Drivers
heading toward the sun will see extra-intense glare. And airliners' windows
may be etched by acid, as happened after the 1982 eruption of Mexico's El
Chichon volcano, said Toon, of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Ames Research Center in Mountain View. Sulfuric acid in the
air comes from huge amounts of sulfur dioxide released by the volcano.;   
Last month's eruption of Mount Pinatubo produced a massive cloud of dust,
sulfur dioxide and other gases that rose into the stratosphere, reaching
altitudes between 80,000 and 120,000 feet. The plume is at least twice as
large as El Chichon's, Toon said, and probably will remain aloft for years.;  
 Jim Lynch, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, is
tracking the plume using instruments aboard the Nimbus-7 satellite. He said,
"All indications are that this eruption has exceeded El Chichon by two or
three times.";    Toon said that in the past 80 years, there have been only
three volcanic eruptions that might have global climatic impact -- El Chichon
in Mexico; Agung, which erupted in Bali in 1963; and Pinatubo.;    The cloud
now covers a zone 30 degrees north and 30 degrees south of the equator, so
almost 50 percent of the globe is blanketed.;    "We're expecting it to stay
around for about five years. With time it will spread north and south from
where it is," Lynch said.;    Whether climatic cooling will result from
Pinatubo's eruption is not known, scientists said. El Chichon may have caused
a fraction of a degree of global cooling, but researchers are still unsure. El
Chichon's eruption coincided with an El Nino climatic event, which may have
reversed or accentuated the volcanic effects. Another El Nino seems to have
started recently, scientists said.;    An El Nino event -- which involves
periodic warming of the Pacific Ocean's surface waters -- can severely disturb
normal climate.  </TEXT>
