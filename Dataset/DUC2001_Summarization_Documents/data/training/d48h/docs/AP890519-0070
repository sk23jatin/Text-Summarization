   A government scientist says his detailed new
analysis disproves the theory that volcanoes are more likely to
erupt at certain times of the year.
   Historically, volcanoes have erupted slightly more often in some
months than others, leading to disputes over whether the variation
was enough to constitute a periodic pattern.
   Richard B. Stothers concluded that it isn't in a report in the
May issue of Geophysical Research Letters, published by the
American Geophysical Union.
   Stothers, of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., compared the dates
of recorded strong volcanic eruptions between 1500 and 1980.
   During that time 265 eruptions were recorded in the first half
of each calendar year and 236 in the last six months, a difference
Stothers said is not statistically significant.
   Breaking down the eruptions by month and area, Stothers did find
some clustering, but this was explainable, he concluded.
   For example, nearly all eruptions south of 50 degrees south
latitude occurred between November and April.
   This is almost certainly because that is summer in that part of
the world, the time of year the nearly uninhabited region is most
often visited by outsiders who would record eruptions, Stothers
said.
   No similar pattern was seen in the far north, where residents
are always present to notice eruptions.
   Stother's monthly analysis found a peak average of 52 eruptions
in February between the years 1500 and 1980 and a minimum of 36
eruptions in the months of April and December during that period.
   The average number of eruptions in other months fell in between
those two, a variation within the range that statisticians would
expect to occur in a random sample.
   Stother's analysis rebuts several studies done in the late 1800s
and early in this century that indicated a seasonality to volcanic
eruptions.
   At least one 1917 report speculated that eruptions would cluster
around the equinoxes in the spring and fall as a result of changes
in the angle of the sun.
   Periodic springtime eruptions of some volcanoes have been
associated with melting snow seeping into the ground and reacting
with molton lava below the ground, scientists have suggested.
   But seasonality occurring at individual volcanoes disappears
when they are averaged in with many others around the world,
according to Stother's analysis.
