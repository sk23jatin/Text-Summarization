<TEXT>     In Japan, heavy rain sent tons of mud and volcanic debris cascading down
Mount Unzen, washing away or damaging at least 70 empty houses and slightly
injuring one fleeing resident, officials said today.;    Weather forecasters
predicted continuing rain in the area.;    In the Philippines, 4,795-foot
Mount Pinatubo is in its fourth week of eruptions after being dormant 600
years. Officials say 338 people have been killed during the eruptions.;   
Volcanologist Julio Sabit said low-frequency tremors, similar to those
observed prior to major eruptions three weeks ago, preceded the ash ejection
this morning.;    Authorities warned residents to be alert for high walls of
flowing volcanic ash, boulders and debris that move rapidly downstream and can
bury whole towns in their path.;    Mudflows hit settlements near the towns of
Porac and Florida Blanca, about 40 miles northwest of Manila.;    Witnesses
said houses were buried up to their rooftops and an undetermined number of
cattle were killed.;    There were sketchy reports today of similar mudflows
in the Balintawak River northwest of the volcano but poor communications made
it impossible to verify the reports.;    Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos,
chairman of the National Disaster Coordinating Council, said crews were
deepening river channels near the volcano in hopes of preventing spillovers.; 
  The eruptions severely damaged the U.S.-run Clark Air Base and Subic Bay
Naval Base, raising doubts over their future. The lease on the bases expires
Sept. 16, and talks resume here this month in an effort to reach an agreement
on a possible extension.;    U.S. officials said today they expect to complete
a damage assessment of the bases by July 9.;    The Philippine government has
also not completed its assessment of overall damage, which was extensive.
Agriculture Secretary Senen Bacani said today that damage to crops alone was
$15 million.;    Near Mount Unzen in Japan, the flow of mud, almost 450 feet
wide, started Sunday and was knee-deep today in an abandoned residential area
along the Mizunashi River.;    Many residents along the river left their homes
after Mount Unzen erupted in early June, killing 41 people. About 1,200 people
were evacuated from the area Sunday as rain swept ash and basketball-size
rocks down three rivers.;    By this afternoon, the mudflow had reached
Shimabara port, five miles east of the 4,485-foot volcano, police said. It
wrecked a bridge and partially blocked a road and a railway as it swept
through Shimabara, a city of 45,000 residents, said a Nagasaki police
officer.;    The observatory monitoring Mount Unzen said volcanic debris still
covering the east side of the mountain lends itself to landslides. It said the
volcano is still spewing out gas, rocks and ash.;    About 9,000 people have
been evacuated from the foot of Mount Unzen.;    Mount Unzen, 610 miles
southwest of Tokyo, erupted Nov. 17 for the first time in 198 years.;    Unzen
was the site of Japan's worst volcanic disaster, which killed about 15,000
people in 1792.  </TEXT>
