   Doctors Wednesday reported a growing number of
stress-related illnesses among people in a resort city southwest of
Tokyo that has been jolted by thousands of tremors and several
volcanic eruptions in the past two weeks.
   ``We've had an increasing number of patients complaining of
insomnia and gastritis due to stress and fear of earthquakes and
volcanic eruptions,'' said Mikio Kakefu, director of the National
Hospital in Ito City.
   Ito, a coastal resort city on the Izu peninsula, about 60 miles
southwest of Tokyo, has had more than 23,000 temblors, including 486
strong enough to be felt, since June 30.
   On July 13, an undersea volcano erupted off the Ito coast,
creating a mound 82 feet high, according to the Maritime Safety
Agency, Japan's coast guard.
   Volcanic activity has slowed since then, and no strong
earthquakes have been recorded since Sunday. No injuries or damages
were reported after the eruption.
   But the Central Meteorological Agency has warned the volcano is
likely to erupt again because the movement of magma, or molten rock,
continues.
   Kakefu said the hospital, which has an average of 250 outpatients
daily, Monday began receiving more patients with stomach aches,
insomnia and diarrhea, ``all from fear and stress.''
   ``They didn't feel sick for a couple of days after the eruption
because they were still tense,'' he said. Kakefu said he does not
have any statistics, but indicated the number of such patients is
likely to increase.
   Pets have also been developing similar symptoms since shortly
after the eruption, said Masaaki Mochizuki, an Ito veterinarian.
   He said he has examined 129 cats and dogs suffering the
``earthquake syndrome'' between July 4 and July 14.
   Symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea and loss of appetite were
frequent among cats, and many dogs suffered skin problems including
rashes and hair loss, he said. He said some dogs were also afflicted
with coughing and trembling due to excessive fear.
   ``My busiest day was July 14, the day after the eruption,''
Mochizuki said. ``Symptoms in animals appeared earlier than in
people because animals are more sensitive, and they feel the
temblors and noises more strongly.''
   ``We humans have information from the municipal office and the
meteorological centers, which help to relieve our tensions ... but
such things don't work for animals,'' he said.
