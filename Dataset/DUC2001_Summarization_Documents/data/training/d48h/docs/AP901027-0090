   Eight years after a volcano scare incited
fear, anger and economic gloom in Sierra resorts, residents are
nonchalant about renewed underground lava movement that is
triggering thousands of tiny earthquakes.
   Scientists say there is a very small chance of a volcanic
eruption. But most of the quakes are too small to be felt, so ``you
don't really think about it,'' said Pam Murphy, spokeswoman for
Mammoth Mountain Ski Area.
   ``You can get hit by a car,'' she said. ``You can be in a plane
crash. The chances of those are a lot higher than the chance of
being killed by an earthquake or a volcano.''
   ``People who are frightened left long ago. I don't believe it's
a conscious concern of anyone in the community,'' said Mammoth
Lakes Mayor Gordon Alper.
   The resort town's 4,700 permanent residents live in Long Valley,
a 19-mile-long, 9-mile-wide volcanic crater known as a caldera. It
is located on the east slope of the Sierra Nevada range 250 miles
north of Los Angeles. The Earth's crust is being stretched apart in
the region, allowing molten rock to fill half-mile-wide chambers
under the caldera.
   The valley was created 730,000 years ago by one of Earth's most
powerful eruptions, a blast that spewed 600 times more material
than the May 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington state.
   Eruptions somewhat smaller than Mount St. Helens' happened 550
years ago at the Inyo craters, which span Long Valley's north rim,
and 650 years ago at the Mono craters, several miles north of the
caldera.
   Despite the current activity, the probability of a major
earthquake or a volcanic eruption in the area is ``less than 1
percent each year,'' said David Hill, the U.S. Geological Survey
geophysicist in charge of research at Long Valley.
   Mono County Sheriff Martin Strelneck called such estimates ``a
scientific guessing game,'' and said area residents rarely discuss
the latest swarm of earthquakes, which started in May 1989.
   That low-key attitude contrasts with feelings of anxiety, denial
and hostility when thousands of quakes - some exceeding 6 on the
Richter scale - rocked the area from 1979 to 1984.
   During that period, subterranean molten rock pushed upward,
lifting the caldera's floor. As a result, the Geological Survey
issued a ``notice of potential volcanic hazard'' for Long Valley in
May 1982.
   That warning, coupled with jarring earthquakes, damaged tourism
and aggravated a recession in the once-booming real estate market.
   ``The community overreacted,'' Murphy said. Residents accused
journalists of sensationalizing the possibility of an eruption and
denounced scientists for scaring people.
   ``Initially we thought this was a big ploy for them to get
funding from Congress,'' Alper said.
   The hazard notice was rescinded in 1984 after the beleaguered
Geological Survey changed its warning system and seismic activity
diminished, reducing the possibility of an eruption.
   Swarms of thousands of small quakes resumed 18 months ago and
continue to rattle Mammoth Lakes, June Lake, Lee Vining and other
Mono County resort towns. The temblors, most measuring 1 to 3 on
the Richter scale, started beneath Mammoth Mountain. In September
1989, they shifted to the caldera, where five to 10 small quakes
now happen daily.
   A quake estimated at 5 to 5.8 on the Richter scale shook the
region last Tuesday, tumbling rocks onto Yosemite National Park's
roads. It was eastern California's largest quake since 1984, but
wasn't related to volcanic activity that causes the quake swarms,
Hill said.
   Long Valley's floor continues to bulge upward as molten rock
moves inside two or three chambers about four miles under the
caldera, he said. The caldera floor rose about 2 feet since 1979,
including 3 inches in the past year.
   While Long Valley ``is clearly an area that's showing unrest,
large calderas can do these kinds of things over years to decades
without necessarily erupting,'' Hill said.
   The floor of a caldera near Naples, Italy, rose 9 feet between
1970 and 1984 but didn't erupt. Comparable uplift inside a New
Guinea caldera also failed to produce volcanic disaster.
   Nevertheless, Hill said, eastern Sierra residents are addressing
the volcanic threat by developing or revising emergency plans and
helping the Geological Survey prepare a new system to issue a
warning if an eruption appeared likely.
