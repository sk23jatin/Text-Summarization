   Dust plumes spewed out by volcanoes, long
thought to cool the climate, may well have little weather effect, a
new study contends.
   ``Previous suggestions of large cooling during the first few
months after volcanic events appear to be unwarranted,''
researchers Clifford F. Mass and David A. Portman say in the June
issue of the Journal of Climate, published by the American
Meteorological Society.
   Volcanic eruptions have often been blamed for cooling of the
climate in the past, based on the theory that the dust they inject
into the atmosphere would block sunlight and reduce the normal
warming of the land and sea surface.
   Indeed, the cold weather in 1816, known to historians as ``the
year without a summer,'' has been widely blamed on a series of
volcanic eruptions that occurred in various parts of the world
between 1812 and 1815.
   In their study, Portman and Mass said prior analyses may have
been confused by temperature changes that involve a periodic
warming and cooling of sea and air temperatures, a pattern known as
the El Nino-Southern Oscillation.
   After subtracting those effects from the historical records,
they concluded that ``only the largest eruptions are suggested in
the climatic record and that a modest cooling is observed for one
to two years after these large events.''
   They defined modest cooling as about one-tenth to two-tenths of
a degree Celsius in average temperatures. That would amount to 0.2
to 0.4 degrees Fahrenheit.
   The authors found little hint of any effect on air pressure or
rain or snowfall.
   Considering that eruptions throwing dust into the air should
interfere with radiation from the sun, they asked themselves: ``Why
is the volcanic effect on surface climate so small?''
   The answer, they concluded, amounts to an altered form of the
greenhouse effect _ the currently widely discussed threatened
heating of the planet.
   ``Volcanic stratospheric aerosols can drastically reduce the
direct solar beam,'' they concluded, an effect which should lower
the temperature by reducing the warming from the sun.
   But at the same time these chemicals and dust also block
infrared rediation from the ground and ocean what would normally be
radiated back into space, cooling the planet.
   Because volcanic clouds often shade only a small portion of the
surface and have only a negligible net effect on the radiation
balance, they result in little measurable climate change, concluded
Mass, of the University of Washington in Seattle, and Portman of
Atmospheric and Environmental Research Inc., Cambridge, Mass.
   Records which seem to indicate cooling following eruptions could
reflect ordinary variations in climate, they conclude. In fact, a
more detailed analysis of the records indicates that in some cases
gradual cooling reported following eruptions had actually begun
beforehand.
   As for 1816, Mass and Portman conclude that it was an unusually
cold summer in North America and parts of Europe, but the degree of
cooling was not unprecedented. The cold year could have resulted
from consistent wind patterns bringing arctic air south, they said.
   The greenhouse effect which has become a source of concern in
recent years results from an accumulation of carbon dioxide and
other gases in the atmosphere, largely a result of burning fossil
fuels and other industrial processes.
   Like volcanic dust, these gases trap the earth's heat,
preventing it from radiating out into space and cooling the planet.
But unlike the volcanic dust, the greenhouse gases do not balance
things by blocking incoming sunlight.
