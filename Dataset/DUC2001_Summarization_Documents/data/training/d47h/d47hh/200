President George Bush's third son Neil, a director of Silverado S&L,
played a part in Silverado's collapse by failing to disclose that two
big borrowers were major investors in his oil exploration company. He
helped arrange loans for William Walters and Kenneth Good, who
defaulted on more than $130 million in Silverado loans. Cleanup could
cost taxpayers $1 billion.

Neil Mallon Bush received an MBA from Tulane and moved to Denver where
he negotiated oil leases before forming JNB Exploration. Because of
his connection to the Vice-President, unqualified 30-year old Neil was
asked to join Silverado's board of directors and served from 1985-88,
resigning after his father's nomination for President.  He described
himself as "just a Denver guy trying to make a living and raise a
family" and denied any wrongdoing.  Friends defended him as honest but
naive.

President Bush pledged not to interfere with the investigation of his
son but may have requested that he be advised by close friend and bank
lobbyist Thomas Ashley.  Closing Silverado was delayed until after
Bush had won the presidential election.  Regulators sought to bar Neil
from future service as a thrift director but in 1990 merely ordered
him to refrain from violations of disclosure rules.  </SUM>
