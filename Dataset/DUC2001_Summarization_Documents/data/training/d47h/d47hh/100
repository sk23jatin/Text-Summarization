Presidential son Neil Bush, a director of Silverado S&L, failed to
disclose that borrowers William Walters and Kenneth Good were major
investors in his company. Their default on more than $130 million in
loans contributed to Silverado~Rs failure. Cleanup could cost
taxpayers $1 billion. Unqualified 30-year old Neil was asked to join
Silverado~Rs board of directors because of his connection to the
Vice-President. President Bush pledged not to interfere with the
investigation of his son but may have requested that he be advised by
a bank-lobbyist friend. Regulators sought stronger penalties but
merely ordered Neil to refrain from violations of disclosure
rules. </SUM>
