<HEAD>Former Regulator: Bush Son On Board Stalled Closure Of Troubled S&amp;L</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Federal officials delayed closing a
troubled Colorado savings and loan largely because President Bush's
son was on its board, a former federal bank regulator charged in a
published report Wednesday.
   ``Neil Bush's presence was a material part of unconscionable
delays in taking over Silverado,'' James Moroney told the San
Francisco Chronicle.
   Moroney is a former staff analyst for the Topeka Federal Home
Loan Bank, which supervised Silverado Savings and Loan of Denver.
   The head of the Topeka bank at the time denied that Neil Bush's
presence was an influence.
   ``The economic substance of Silverado's loan portfolio was
comparable to a Ponzi scheme (a type of pyramid investment fraud),
and it couldn't have worked out,'' said Moroney, 42, a Kansas City
lawyer who left the Topeka bank after six months in 1986.
   ``It was insolvent back (in 1986). It was not a judgment call.
That place, clearly, was very insolvent,'' Moroney said.
   Neil Bush resigned from Silverado's board just after his father
won the Republican nomination in 1988 and only four months before
the S&amp;L's seizure.
   The Chronicle also reported that documents it obtained show top
federal regulators knew the thrift's financial situation was bad
enough to mandate restrictions on investments and insider deals at
least 14 months before it was closed Dec. 9, 1988.
   Moroney said he believes a big reason his district superiors,
including former Topeka bank president Kermit Mowbray, allowed
Silverado to continue was their knowledge that Neil Bush and
Republican Party fund raiser Larry Mizel, of MDC Holdings, were
involved with the institution.
   Mowbray, who retired the month that Silverado closed, denied
Moroney's allegations Tuesday, saying: ``Neil Bush being on that
board had no effect on our decisions.'' Mowbray, who said he never
met Bush, also denied knowing that Silverado was insolvent in 1986.
   In 1986, Moroney said he approached a fellow supervisor and
asked: ``Why are we putting up with this Silverado? We would not
permit that type of loan work-out for another institution.''
   ``And he looked at me, and said, `Well, you know who one of the
directors is.' And I said, `No.' And he said, `The vice president's
son. Neil Bush,''' Moroney told the Chronicle.
   However, he said he has no evidence that either Bush or Mizel
exerted direct pressure for ``the preferential treatment they
got.'' He said their presence was enough to cause Mowbray to take
an extraordinary interest in Silverado and to proceed cautiously in
the case.
   Bush, reached by telephone at his office in Denver, said, ``I'm
going to cooperate in any way I'm asked to. It would be
inappropriate for me to get into any details except with
authorities investigating Silverado.''
   In a news conference Wednesday in Washington, D.C., President
Bush's spokesman Marlin Fitzwater was asked whether the president
was concerned that Silverado's collapse might have have been partly
due to regulators who were ``fearful of Neil Bush's role.''
   Fitzwater replied, ``These matters are all under investigation
and consideration and we won't offer any comment on any aspect of
it. I might say, Neil's been off that board for a long time.''
   President Bush is scheduled to visit Denver on Friday.
