   To hear Neil Bush tell it, he's ``just a Denver
guy trying to make a living and raise a family,'' and he's
bewildered and angry at the attention he's receiving.
   Neil Bush, 35, slim, tanned, blond father of three children,
epitomizes the young, enterprising businessmen who came to Colorado
in the early 1980s to get rich in the oil business.
   ``We lived month to month, begged for money from time to time,
and our business was relatively dormant,'' Bush recalls. But he
relishes that time in his life.
   Like his father, Bush speaks in deliberate, run-on sentences,
tipping his head during delivery, jabbing his finger occasionally,
laughing an engaging, hiccuppy sort of laugh, displaying
near-perfect teeth.
   He is comfortable enough in front of a television camera to be a
political commentator, which he was, briefly, two years ago at KMGH
in Denver.
   Lately, however, Bush hasn't been in the spotlight voluntarily.
   Bush faces a public disciplinary hearing before federal
regulators in September on his role as a director of the bankrupt
Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan. Some Democrats are pushing for
a special prosecutor to examine the case.
   He has been accused of conflict of interest and failure to
disclose ties to men who received loans from Silverado, but has
said he has done nothing wrong. His father has defended his ``honor
and integrity'' but has promised to stay out of the investigation.
   The subject makes Neil Bush angry. While some maintain he played
a major role in pushing through suspicious loans while a director
of Silverado, he is enraged that Democrats are now making political
hay out of his predicament.
   ``Neil Bush is it for the Democrats. I'm the highest-profile guy
they have to shoot at out there,'' he said in an interview last
week.
   ``As a director of Silverado I acted prudently, I acted
responsibly. I acted and took my responsibilities seriously, and I
acted with diligence in overseeing the activities of Silverado.''
He also expresses anger at what he calls ``government
mismanagement'' in the way troubled savings institutions are being
sold off.
   Neil Bush played his most prominent role on the hot, steamy
night of Aug. 17, 1988, at the Republican National Convention in
New Orleans, when he delivered all of Colorado's delegates to help
seal his father's nomination for president.
   It was a heady moment for the third of George and Barbara Bush's
four sons, and it led to suggestions Neil Bush might have the stuff
from which U.S. House or Senate candidates are made. The
possibility had him shrugging and smiling and saying ``maybe.''
   His job then, he told reporters, was to help his father's
campaign. ``I'd hate to be the only son to have lost his home state
for his dad.''
   Dyslexic as a child, Bush practiced reading exercises until he
was able to overcome his problem, his brother George recalled. He
eventually earned undergraduate and master's degrees in business
from Tulane University.
   Until a few months ago, Neil and Sharon Bush and their three
children lived in a tan brick, two-story home in a friendly,
established neighborhood in central Denver.
   Former neighbors say they would often pile into the family Volvo
for weekend excursions. And they were community oriented, with Neil
serving on the Children's Museum board and Sharon co-chairing the
1989 Children's Hospital Gala.
   The family moved to a new house, a $550,000 structure on
Denver's wealthier, newer, southeast side. ``It offers privacy,
something that I now thrive on,'' Bush says.
   His downtown office is light and airy, with Western paintings
and a clear view to the west, where the Rockies can be seen on most
days. His desk carries a name plate, ``Mr. Bush,'' which belonged
to his grandfather, Prescott Bush, when he was a U.S. Senator from
Connecticut.
   It is more lavish than he was accustomed to when he was a
partner in a fledgling exploration company, JNB Exploration Co.
   JNB paid him a salary _ he won't say how much _ but the business
was later sold, in 1989, and Bush now heads Apex Energy, also an
exploration company.
   ``My business is oil and gas,'' he said.
   Bush says the oil business has been interesting, and he made
some profit selling lease-hold interests.
   ``The only problem is,'' he recalls with a smile, ``even though
we kept things going and everything was in pretty good shape in
terms of operations _ we didn't find any oil.
   ``It's a pretty high-risk business. But we were successful to
the extent we managed to put prospects together and sell them,
which is probably why we attracted the partners we did.''
