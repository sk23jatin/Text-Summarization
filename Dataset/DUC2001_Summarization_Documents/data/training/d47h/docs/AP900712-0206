   President Bush's son Neil was unqualified to
be a director of a Colorado thrift, but that doesn't excuse him
from harm caused to the institution that failed at a cost of $1
billion, federal regulators say.
   Neil Bush described himself Wednesday as ``just a Denver guy
trying to make a living and raise a family,'' and not as a
freewheeling former director of Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan
Association.
   Bush, 34, continued to deny conflict of interest allegations
raised against him by thrift regulators.
   Meanwhile, President Bush strongly defended his son on
Wednesday, saying he has confidence in his ``honor and integrity.''
   The president, who has pledged to vigorously prosecute fraud in
the savings and loan industry, repeated his promise not to
interfere with regulators' investigation of his son.
   ``If he's done something wrong, the system will digest that,''
he told a news conference in Houston. ``This is not easy for me as
a father. It's easy for me as a president because the system is
going to work. I am not going to intervene.''
   In documents released by the Office of Thrift Supervision,
regulators asserted that Neil Bush was ``unqualified and
untrained'' for his position as an outside director of Denver-based
Silverado.
   ``Certainly he had no experience in managing a large
corporation, especially a financial institution with almost $2
billion in assets,'' said the documents released this week.
``Unfortunately, he was not cognizant of the conflict-of-interest
situations he encountered as a director of Silverado.''
   However, the regulators added, Bush's inexperience does not
excuse him ``from the harm and potential harm he caused'' to the
thrift.
   The younger Bush has been ordered by the thrift office to answer
allegations of conflict of interest in his role as a director of
Silverado, which lent millions of dollars to his business partner,
who never repaid the money.
   At a news conference in Denver, Neil Bush said, ``I am standing
on very solid ground when it comes to defending my role as an
outside director.''
   He said that his father ``had wanted me to keep a little lower
profile.''
   However, he told reporters for The Denver Post after the news
conference that he is thinking about running for Congress because
he thinks there should be more congressional accountability. ``I
may (run),'' he said. ``Not anytime soon because it's something I
have to build up to. But if I do it, it's probably going to be with
the intent of being part of a shakeup.''
   The federal government is considering filing lawsuits to recover
misspent funds from the officers and directors of 1,300 failed
banks and savings institutions, officials told a congressional
hearing Wednesday. Neil Bush could be among the defendants.
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., appearing at Wednesday's hearing, declined to comment on
whether FDIC officials have recommended whether to sue Neil Bush.
   ``We are treating the Silverado case the way we treat every
other case,'' Seidman told the House Judiciary subcommittee on
criminal justice. ``Every failed institution, we go into and make a
thorough investigation of whether or not there is the possibility
of civil or criminal activity.''
   In other savings and loan developments Wednesday:
   _The Senate approved a broad crime bill that stiffens prison
terms for savings and loan fraud and offers rewards to
whistleblowers for turning in S&amp;L looters.
   _The former president of one of Texas' largest collapsed thrifts
was indicted on fraud charges in connection with a $700 million
real estate scheme. FBI officials in Dallas announced the
indictment against Edwin T. McBirney III, former president of
Sunbelt Savings Association.
   The regulators asserted that Bush was unqualified to sit on
Silverado's board. They noted that he graduated from college in
1977, worked on his father's political campaign for a year and
received a master's degree in business administration in 1979.
   The documents also noted that Bush worked as an oil lease
negotiator for Amoco Production Co. in Denver from 1980 through
late 1982, and later started his own oil company, JNB Exploration.
He became a director of Silverado in the summer of 1985 and quit
the job in August 1988, shortly after his father won the Republican
presidential nomination.
   In earlier years, Bush held summer jobs with Republic National
Bank in Dallas and a small oil equipment company there.
