   Congressional Democrats are one signature
short of the 12 needed to demand the appointment of a special
prosecutor to examine the collapse of a savings and loan led by
Neil Bush.
   Meanwhile, former Rep. Thomas L. Ashley said Friday he has been
regularly advising President Bush's son on his savings and loan
troubles as a longtime family friend _ but not at the president's
request.
   Neil Bush told federal regulators last December that Ashley, a
banking industry official who was a college classmate of the
president's, ``apparently, you know, called my father, and then so
at Dad's request he called me.''
   Ashley confirmed in a telephone interview he has talked to the
president about Neil Bush but said he contacted the son on his own
after reading of his troubles in the newspaper. He said President
Bush was well aware of his activity.
   Rep. Edward F. Feighan, D-Ohio, withdrew his name Friday from a
petition to trigger the independent counsel law in the Neil Bush
case, leaving Democrats one short of the 12 signatures needed to
trigger the independent counsel law.
   The law requires the signature of at least 12 Democrats, a
majority of the 21 on the committee, to make the request for a
special prosecutor.
   Andrea Camp, a spokeswoman for Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., who
is organizing the Democratic effort, said, ``I don't think it's a
question of whether we get another signature, but when. It's a live
proposal.''
   Feighan wrote in a letter to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh,
``Although I had originally signed a draft of this request, I
notified the authors of the letter earlier today that my name and
signature should be withdrawn from the document that would be
delivered to you.''
   He did not indicate why he had changed his mind.
   And Democratic House Speaker Thomas S. Foley lashed back at a
Republican official's accusation that the Democrats were to blame
for a national S&amp;L crisis expected to cost taxpayers hundreds of
billions of dollars.
   Ed Rollins, chairman of the Republican Congressional Campaign
Committee, said the Democrats had sold out ``for a few million
dollars in campaign contributions.'' But the normally mild-mannered
Foley, D-Wash., angrily dismissed Rollins as ``in a panic ... an
out of control person'' making an ``unrestrained and totally raw
partisan accusation.''
   Tempers on all sides have risen as more attention has been given
to Neil Bush, who faces a public disciplinary hearing before
federal regulators in September on his role as a director of the
bankrupt Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan.
   He has been accused of conflict of interest but has said he has
done nothing wrong. His father, the president, has twice defended
his ``honor and integrity'' during news conferences but has
promised to stay out of the investigation.
   Neil Bush's statement to federal regulators is contained in a
deposition included in documents released by the Office of Thrift
Supervision. It was first reported Friday in The Denver Post.
   Asked by the regulators whether he had ever discussed operations
of the S&amp;L with his father, the younger Bush replied:
   ``I didn't discuss details with him. And if he inquired about
Silverado, it would have been very rare, I mean if at all, and I
don't know if I ever voluntarily disclosed to him when I was a
member of the board anything about the goings on of Silverado.''
   He added, ``I never, I can state this with great clarity, that I
never intentionally brought him into, you know, I mean I never
asked him for assistance or advice on Silverado matters.''
   In response to the regulators' questions, Neil Bush said no one
had suggested to him what his testimony on any matter should be.
   Schroeder one of the petition signers among the Democrats on the
Judiciary Committee, said their request for a special prosecutor
was made because ``the people have a right to feel we're doing
everything to get impartial justice done.''
   She said there is a public sense that in the S&amp;L mess and now
the aftermath, ``it's who you know, not what you know or what
you've done.''
   Justice Department spokesman Dan Eramian said, ``The letter is
under consideration as provided for under the independent counsel
statutes.''
   Thornburgh has 15 days to decide whether to open a preliminary
inquiry to determine if a special prosecutor should be appointed,
then another 15 days to tell Congress how he acted on its request.
He has 90 days from start of the preliminary inquiry to determine
whether to appoint an independent counsel.
   Ashley, a former Democratic congressman from Ohio, said Friday,
``I've talked to the president (about his son's situation) on a
couple of social occasions, when we're alone. ... I talk about the
kids. Neil's one of the kids.''
   Ashley said that his own experience in politics and in bank
regulation made him a good source of advice for Neil Bush. ``The
situation is such that he can't go to his father and talk to him,''
Ashley said.
   Ashley, who was a college classmate of George Bush's at Yale,
denied President Bush had asked him to intervene. He said, ``If
Neil thinks his father called me, he's mistaken.''
   Ashley, 67, is president of the Association of Bank Holding
Companies, a banking lobbying organization based in Washington. The
organization generally does not get involved in savings and loan
issues, Ashley said.
   He said he contacted Neil Bush on his own last winter after
reading about his troubles in newspapers.
   Since then, ``I've seen Neil a half dozen times. We talk about
it,'' Ashley said.
   He said he is not trying to serve as a go-between for Neil Bush
and the president, nor trying to influence any decisions. ``I'm too
smart for that,'' Ashley said.
   Ashley and Bush have remained close friends since they were both
members of the secret society Skull and Bones while they were
undergraduates at Yale University in the late 1940s.
   ``Is everyone who is close to the president supposed to stay
away from Neil?'' Ashley asked. President Bush ``doesn't go along
with that. He rejects that,'' the former lawmaker added.
   Ashley said that Neil Bush has made up his own mind in the
matter, including his decision to fight the case and refusal to
negotiate an out-of-court settlement.
   ``I'm a good sounding board,'' he said. ``It's not a partisan
matter or he wouldn't be coming to a Democrat.''
