   U.S. military experts left the Persian
Gulf on Thursday after a 3{-week investigation of the destruction
of an Iranian airliner by an American warship, Navy officials said.
   The team led by Rear Adm. William M. Fogarty arrived July 5, two
days after missiles fired by the cruiser USS Vincennes hit an Iran
Air Airbus flying over the Strait of Hormuz, killing all 290 people
aboard.
   Pentagon officials said officers of the Vincennes mistook the
Airbus A300 for an Iranian F-14 jet fighter on an attack course.
   Fogarty's team worked in secret and made no statements before
leaving.
   The U.S. Navy officials said the report would ``work its way up
the chain of command'' to Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci. Because
Carlucci is in the Soviet Union until about Aug. 8, they said, the
report could not be released until mid-August.
   Investigators compiled data from computer tapes on the Vincennes
and two other U.S. warships that were in the area, the frigate USS
Elmer Montgomery and missile frigate John H. Sides.
   They also took sworn testimony from the commander of the
Vincennes, Capt. Will C. Rogers III, and other officers of the
three warships.
   An initial 15-day deadline for the investigation was extended at
Fogarty's request.
   The Navy officials would not give details of the investigations
and said contact with Iran for information would have to be through
diplomatic channels. The Vincennes has been assigned to the Arabian
Sea, just outside the Persian Gulf, and is expected to complete its
tour at the end of summer.
   In Ottawa, Iranian diplomat Gholamreza Behtashi said a
five-member team from the International Civil Aviation Organization
is expected to arrive Friday in Tehran, Iran's capital, to pursue
its own investigation into the disaster.
   Behtashi, third secretary at the Iranian Embassy, said the team
is made up of technical personnel from the Montreal-based United
Nations agency.
   ``They will go from Tehran to the Persian Gulf and investigate
the various aspects of the incident,'' Behtashi said.
   Iran asked the governing council of the agency to meet in
special session to condemn the attack, but members refused to
censure the United States.
   The 33-nation governing council ordered the inquiry on July 14.
   U.S. delegate Edmund Stohr said the United States will offer the
investigating team whatever help it can. He said the team had not
asked to board the Vincennes, and he didn't know if such a visit
would be possible considering the military situation in the gulf.
   ICAO is a technical body composed of 159 nations. It sets
standards for civil aviation and airline safety.
