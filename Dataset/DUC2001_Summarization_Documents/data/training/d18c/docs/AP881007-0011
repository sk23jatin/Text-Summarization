   Psychologists who studied the downing of an
Iranian civilian airliner in the Persian Gulf say the military
needs to better understand stress and should spend more on
psychological research and improve its crew training.
   The judgment of the Navy cruiser crew that mistakenly shot down
the Iranian plane July 3 was clouded by misconceptions caused by
stress, the psychologists said.
   ``There is much knowledge about how decisions go wrong and how
they can be improved that is not being put to use in military
decision-making,'' Dr. Paul Slovic, a psychology professor from the
University of Oregon, told a House panel Thursday.
   Dr. Steven Zornetzer, representing the Navy's office of naval
research, responded that the service does try to consider stress
and is spending $12 million a year on basic research into
psychological questions. Another $18 million is being spent to
apply the results of that research to Navy programs.
   While progess is being made, he said, ``it must be clearly
recognized that these research problems are among the most
difficult and complex in the entire research spectrum.''
   The hearing by the House Armed Services policy subcommittee was
part of the panel's examination of the destruction of Iran Air
Flight 655 that killed all 290 people on board. It was shot down by
the cruiser Vincennes in the mistaken belief that the commercial
jetliner was a military plane diving toward the Vincennes.
   A Navy investigation attributed the incident to stress-related
mistakes made by the crew of the Aegis-class cruiser, one of the
Navy's most sophisticated warships.
   The Navy said crew members, under battle-caused stress after
just finishing a firefight with Iranian gunboats, misread or
misinterpreted a variety of electronic data from the Aegis
computers.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the panel, said,
``Misinterpretations of data provided by the Aegis weapon system
and chaotic communications in the command center have pointed up
troubles with man's ability to make fast, accurate decisions in
combat.''
   Dr. Richard Nisbett, a psychology professor at the University of
Michigan, noted that the Vincennes crew was on alert for an attack
by Iranian planes. The crew members interpreted the data to see
what they expected to see, he said.
   ``Expectations can color what people think they see, and what
they remember, to a far greater degree than is recognized by common
sense,'' Nisbett said.
   ``Magicians and card sharks have long made a living on this
principle, and in the last 30 years or so psychologists have
learned a great deal about the scope of the principle in daily life
events,'' he said.
   Nisbett also noted the example of the USS Stark, which was hit
by an Iraqi missile in May 1987, killing 37 seamen. Top officers on
the Stark were disciplined for not firing their weapons against the
Iraqi plane, and Navy ships in the region were on a high state of
alert after that.
   The Vincennes crew wanted to avoid another incident like that
involving the Stark, Nisbett said.
   Dr. Richard Helmreich, a psychology professor at the University
of Texas, said the Vincennes crew members didn't communicate among
themselves well enough.
   ``The communications problems evident in the Vincennes incident
closely parallel those uncovered in analyses of the causes of
crashes in civilian and military air transport,'' he said.
   Dr. Richard W. Pew said another risk arises from the highly
automated, computerized nature of modern warships like the
Vincennes.
   ``Research is badly needed to understand when and just how much
automation to introduce in situations where the ultimate control
and responsibility must rest with the human operators,'' he said.
