<HEAD>15 Vincennes Sailors Disciplined for Drug Use</HEAD>

   The Navy announced Friday that 15 crew members
of the USS Vincennes, the cruiser that shot down an Iranian
jetliner in the Persian Gulf last summer, will be disciplined for
drug abuse.
   ``There is no connection now to the July 3 incident in the
Persian Gulf to what has happened on board the Vincennes,'' said
Navy Cmdr. David Dillon, spokesman for Pacific Fleet Surface Force
headquarters.
   The Vincennes, meanwhile, will be shifted to Long Beach Naval
Shipyard within five weeks for modifications to correct
deficiencies in the Aegis electronic combat control system, The
(San Diego) Tribune reported Friday.
   Aegis, which would enable a ship like the Vincennes to make
computer-recommended battle decisions for entire fleets, was found
flawed in the Persian Gulf confrontation.
   According to Pentagon analysts, split-second decisions were
affected by the inability of radar-scope interpreters to
immediately match the plane's ``blip'' with digital direction,
altitude and speed information displayed on another screen.
   Those problems are one reason the Vincennes will undergo
modernization, an unidentified source told The Tribune.
   None of the sailors involved in the drug sweep were in positions
that may have influenced the decision by Capt. Will C. Rogers III
to fire two anti-aircraft missiles at the jetliner, Dillon said.
All 290 aboard the plane died.
   Of the 15 sailors, six are being processed for discharge from
the Navy, while six others have been given warnings, Dillon said.
   ``Three are petty officers who are being investigated for
possible court-martial in connection with drug sales,'' he said.
   Dillon noted that the 15 sailors represent 3.9 percent of the
384 sailors on board. ``That is less than the 5.4 percent average
for the entire Navy,'' he said.
   The announcement came as preparations were under way at the
Naval Station San Diego for Saturday's change of command aboard the
Vincennes.
   Rogers will be rotated to a new assignment at the Navy's
Tactical Training Group in San Diego. The new Vincennes commander
is Capt. Robert B. Lynch, who had been stationed in Washington,
D.C., and is assuming his fifth sea command.
   Rogers and his wife, Sharon, have been under guard by the Naval
Investigative Service since a pipe bomb exploded under the family
van Mrs. Rogers was driving to her teaching job March 10 in La
Jolla. She escaped injury.
   The FBI is investigating the attack as possible terrorist
retaliation for the airliner's destruction.
