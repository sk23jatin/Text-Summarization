   A five-man U.N. team arrived in the
Iranian capital of Tehran today to investigate the downing an
Iranian jetliner by a U.S. warship. American experts wrapped up
their probe in the Persian Gulf.
   The International Civil Aviation Organization team planned to
start its probe at Tehran international airport, where part of
Iran's air traffic control network is based, said Iran's official
Islamic Republic News Agency.
   The group from the Montreal-based U.N. agency planned to travel
to Bandar Abbas airport in southern Iran, from which the Iran Air
Airbus took off on a brief scheduled flight to Dubai on July 5.
   Iran says all 290 aboard were killed after the plane was hit by
missiles from the cruiser USS Vincennes. Pentagon officials said
officers of the Vincennes mistook the Airbus A300 for an Iranian
F-14 jet fighter on an attack course.
   The ICAO experts also will go to the area where the plane
crashed into the sea near the Iranian island of Hengham in the
Strait of Hormuz, the Iranian agency said in a dispatch monitored
in Cyprus.
   The experts will stay in Iran for a week, the news agency said.
The team is in Iran at the request of the Iranian government to
help resolve discrepancies in accounts given by the two sides.
   The U.S. team left the gulf Thursday after spending 3{ weeks in
the region, Navy officials said. The team led by Rear Adm. William
M. Fogarty arrived July 5, two days after the disaster.
   Fogarty's team worked in secret and made no statements before
leaving. U.S. Navy officials said a report will not be released
before mid-August.
   Investigators compiled data from computer tapes on the Vincennes
and two other U.S. warships that were in the area, the frigate USS
Elmer Montgomery and missile frigate John H. Sides.
   They also took sworn testimony from the commander of the
Vincennes, Capt. Will C. Rogers III, and other officers of the
three warships.
   Iran asked the 33-nation governing council of the International
Civil Aviation Organization to meet in special session to condemn
the attack, but members refused to censure the United States.
   U.S. delegate Edmund Stohr said the United States will offer the
U.N. investigating team whatever help it can. He said the team had
not asked to board the Vincennes, and he didn't know if such a
visit would be possible considering the military situation in the
gulf.
   ICAO is a technical body composed of 159 nations. It sets
standards for civil aviation and airline safety.
