In July 1988 the USS Vincennes, an Aegis class cruiser, used missiles
to shoot down an Iranian civil aircraft, killing 290 people. The Navy
blamed the shootdown on target misidentification. Iran protested,
calling it unprovoked aggression. A United States team and a United
Nations team investigated. The skipper of the Vincennes was eventually
assigned to shore duty and awarded the Legion of Merit. The Vincennes
was sent to Long Beach where deficiencies of the Aegis could be
corrected. A suit was filed in the United States on behalf of the
families of 83 victims. Another ship commander criticized the
aggressive action of the Vincennes. </SUM>
