On July 3, 1988 the USS Vincennes, equipped with the sophisticated
Aegis system, fired two missiles at an Iranian Air Airbus flying a
scheduled flight, destroying the aircraft and killing all 290 on
board. The Navy said that a mistake in misidentifying the target
accounted for the shootdown. Iran did not accept that explanation, and
called the shootdown an act of unprovoked aggression. Psychologists
later said that battle-related stress might have caused the mistake.

Shortly after it happened a team of experts from the United States
investigated the incident. A group from the International Civil Air
Organization went to Iran and investigated from that side.

Months later the wife of the commander of the Vincennes escaped injury
in what may have been a terrorist act. In 1989 Captain Rogers who had
commanded the Vincennes was assigned to shore duty, and awarded the
Legion of Merit. The Vincennes was later sent to the Long Beach Naval
Shipyard where deficiencies in the Aegis could be corrected.

In June 1989 a suit was filed on behalf of the families of 83 of the
victims, charging General Electric and others responsible for the
Aegis. An officer who commanded ship in the vicinity of the shootdown
criticized actions taken by the Vincennes. </SUM>
