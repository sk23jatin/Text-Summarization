<CAPTION>  Photos (3), map; MAP: Reported by Maggie Hirsch, graphic by Kevin
Boyd--Mercury News.; A continent starved for relief; Overshadowed by recent
world disasters, a hunger crisis of potentially epic proportions is unfolding
in Africa. As many as 27 million people -- 3 percent of the population -- may
face starvation. Six countries have severe food shortages, and world relief
resources already have been severely strained.; Previous faminesCivil strife
and drought have been major factors in Africa's food crises. Here are the
continent's most serious, recent food emergencies in which large numbers of
people died:; 1967-'69; Nigeria (Biafra secession): 1 million deaths;
1973-'74; Ethiopia: 100,000 deaths; Burundi: 100,000 deaths; The Sahel
(Senegal, Mauritania, Mali, Upper Volta, Nigeria, Niger, Chad): 100,000
deaths; 1983-'85; Ethiopia: 300,000 deaths; Sudan: 150,000 deaths; Mozambique:
100,000 deaths; 1987-'88; Mozambique: 100,000 deaths; 1988; Sudan: 250,000
deaths; Relief agencies; These are some of the main relief agencies
concentrating on African famine relief:; Adventist Development and Relief
Agency International; 12501 Columbia Pike; Silver Spring, MD 20904; (301)
680-6380; CARE; 660 First Ave.; New York, NY 10016; (212) 686-3110; Catholic
Relief Services; 209 West Fayette St.; Baltimore, MD 21201; (301) 625-2220;
Oxfam America; 115 Broadway; Boston, MA 02116; (617) 482-1211; World Concern;

W. Huntington Dr.; Monrovia, CA 91016; (818) 303-8811; Sudan; Affected
population(*): Up to 9 million, including 7.7 million at risk of starvation;
Causes: Drought, crop failure, civil strife; U.S. assistance(*)(*):
$50,781,463; International assistance: Figure not available; Some 1.2 million
metric tons of food are needed immediately; 300,000 tons more are needed to
avoid a crisis next year. The Sudanese government has refused permission for
relief flights to war-torn southern Sudan, and some programs have been
suspended due to lack of funds.; Angola; Affected population(*): 1.9 million,
including 800,000 at immediate risk of starvation.; Causes: Four consecutive
years of drought; displaced persons due to 15-year civil war; below normal
spring harvest; U.S. assistance(*)(*): $20,855,116 allocated, $9,100,000
pending; International assistance: $6,119,924 (plus $14,326,800 pledged);
85,920 metric tons of food; Despite adequate rainfall, a shortage of seeds
limited the size of the spring harvest. Some 385,000 tons of cereal grains are
needed. United Nations relief efforts that had been suspended due to civil
conflict have resumed.; Ethiopia; Affected population(*): 4.6 to 6 million
people, in regions of Eritrea, Tigray and Harerge, plus 1 million refugees.;
Causes: Drought, civil war; U.S. assistance(*)(*): $52,793,134; International
assistance: $34,341,739; There have been poor harvests for two years in a row,
and 1,165,000 tons of cereal grains are needed. The large number of refugees
adds to the relief problem. Previous agreements between rebels and government
continue to allow delivery of some aid.; West Africa (Liberia, Cote d'Ivoire,
Guinea, Sierra Leone); Affected population(*): 1.2 million in Liberia; 760,000
elsewhere.; Causes: Civil unrest has forced hundreds of thousands from their
homes.; U.S. assistance(*)(*): $127,465,034 (additional $1,985,000 from U.S.
private agencies); International assistance: $76,908,823; Some 181,000 tons of
cereal grains are needed. Only a fifth of the amount of grain pledged, 149,000
tons, has been delivered. Despite Liberia's serious internal problems, relief
agencies have been able to operate.; Somalia; Affected population(*): 100,000
Ethiopian refugees, 140,000 Somalis.; Causes: Civil strife; U.S.
assistance(*)(*): $16,615,250; International assistance: Figure not available;
Some 236,000 tons of cereal grain are needed. Because of the intense fighting,
relief operations have been extremely difficult. Also, the government has been
unwilling to assist relief efforts in rebel areas.; Mozambique; Affected
population(*): 4.5 million.; Causes: 15 years of civil war, nationwide food
shortages, economic stagnation; U.S. assistance(*)(*): $46,262,149;
International assistance: $103,241,135; About 713,000 tons of cereal grains
are needed; only 507,000 had been received. Relief operations have been
hampered by guerrilla attacks on convoys. As well, food aid has been diverted
or stolen.; Amounts of food needed are estimates.; (*) Includes displaced
persons and victims of food shortages or drought; (*)(*) 1991 U.S. government
assistance; does not include U.S. private agency assistance.; Source: U.S.

<LEADPARA>  Imagine every man, woman and child in California going hungry.;    This is
what the famine looming over Africa means: 27 million Africans are hungry and
in danger of starving. Their predicament results from drought, crop failure
and civil war. For those misfortunes they may soon begin paying a high price.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "They're going to begin dying like bloody flies," said Ed Rist, head of
CARE's East Africa unit. "I don't think we've seen anything quite like this.";
   Even as Africa slips into what could become the worst human disaster in its
history, there is debate about whether the United States should aggressively
intervene or offer assistance with political conditions attached.;    And a
spate of disasters worldwide is sending attention and humanitarian aid
elsewhere.;    In Latin America, more than 160,000 cholera cases have been
reported, including 1,203 deaths. On the Turkey-Iraq border, thousands of
Kurdish families still bury their dead and struggle to survive.;    In
Bangladesh, rescue workers continue to find drowned babies lashed to uprooted
trees, tied on by parents who wanted to protect their young from the cyclone
that devastated the country.;    "Interest in a disaster is contingent on
media coverage," said Alex deWaal, associate director of London-based Africa
Watch. "It's become a bit of a circus. When there is coverage, politicians
take an active interest and it becomes a policy issue. You're not seeing that
coverage in Africa yet.";    Other famines there, most recently in the mid-
and late 1980s, focused the attention of Westerners with the media's shocking
images of the crisis, including skeletal children suckling at their mothers'
dry breasts.;    Such photos of the current crisis are hard to come by because
of the lack of media coverage.;    "By the time we see the kind of pictures
that would motivate people to act, it will be too late," said Peter Laugharn,
coordinator for Save the Children's Horn of Africa program.;    Already,
however, hundreds of Africans in Sudan, Somalia and Ethiopia may be on the
verge of death by starvation, relief workers say. Because of internal
government opposition, civil war and an undeveloped infrastructure, delivering
food supplies and obtaining accurate numbers are difficult and sometimes
impossible, they say.;    "We know there are places almost out of food," said
Rist.;    Just as the need is exploding, however, resources of relief programs
such as CARE are decreasing, according to reports from the General Accounting
Office and the Committee on Refugees.;    The United States remains the
world's biggest aid donor, contributing more than $250 million last year. And
some in Congress are trying to guarantee that money and the supplies it buys
get to their proper destination.;    A comprehensive hunger bill, for example,
was introduced by Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, chairman of the Select Committee on
Hunger. The bill would make it a human rights violation to use food as a
weapon, said a staff member. It would authorize U.N. intervention if a country
blocked aid from its population. Several African governments, including Sudan,
have been accused in the past of doing just that.;    Human rights violations
outlined in reports by Africa Watch and Amnesty International have led some
people to suggest that the United States and United Nations should attach
conditions to humanitarian aid. Otherwise, they say, food often is given to
soldiers, who in turn keep oppressive governments in power.;    Although
officials at the Agency for International Development won't confirm it, relief
workers say the agency diverted a shipment of food from Mozambique until the
country promised the food would be delivered to its hungry population instead
of to the army.  </TEXT>
