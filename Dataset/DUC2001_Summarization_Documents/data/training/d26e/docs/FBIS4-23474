  [Text] Lilongwe June 6 SAPA -- Three million people will 
need emergency food aid in 1994/95 following widespread crop 
failure in central and southern Malawi, the United Nations Food 
Aid Organisation [FAO] said on Monday [6 June]. A recent 
FAO/World Food Programme crop assessment mission blamed the crop 
failure on erratic and insufficient rainfall. 
  This year's cereal production among smallholders is 
estimated 
to be 60 per cent less than last year's bumper harvest, and only 
28 per cent higher than in 1991/92, when drought devasted 
southern Africa. The mission estimated about 493,000 tons of 
cereals would have to be imported. 
  Of the cereal food aid requirement, about 175,000 tons would 
be needed as emergency assistance for some three million people. 
Another 270,000 tons would be required to be sold in the market 
to stabilise food supply and prices. 
  "Food scarcity in the markets leads to riots, hoarding and 
skyrocketing prices. That happened during the big drought of 
1992. We attach equal importance to keeping the commercial 
sector well-supplied," said WFP Director Phillip Ostenso. 
  Despite a bumper harvest last year, Malawi has not recovered 
from the massive 1991/92 drought. The sharp decline in the 
production of major crops such as tobacco and cotton due to 
drought means reduced incomes for many rural households. 
  Malnutrition rates have always been very high in Malawi, 
even 
with good harvests. Studies suggest more than half of rural 
pre-school children suffer from chronic malnutrition. Thus food 
shortages and high prices can quickly aggravate an already 
critical situation. 
  Although landlocked, Malawi proved in the 1991/92 drought it 
was adequately equipped to handle the transportation, storage 
and internal distribution of large volumes of food imported 
through South Africa, Mozambican or, possibly, Tanzanian ports 
[words indistinct].
