   President Quett Masire of Botswana said
Thursday that industrial nations can help relieve drought and hunger
in Africa by reducing global warming caused by the greenhouse effect.
   Masire and Dr. Bernard Ledea Ouedraogo, an anti-hunger organizer
in Burkina Faso, were honored as co-winners of the 1988 Africa Prize
for Leadership for their efforts in averting hunger.
   A severe drought gripped much of Africa from 1981 to 1987,
killing millions. Experts believe that due to the organizing efforts
of Masire's government, not one person died of drought-induced
famine in Botswana.
   Through early planning, Botswana organized a nutritional
surveillance and warning system and distributed food nationwide.
   By the time the drought ended, malnutrition had actually
declined. Before the drought, 25 percent of Botswana's children were
underweight. By 1987, that fell to 15 percent.
   In his acceptance speech, Masire thanked Western donor
governments and private agencies for their help during the drought,
but suggested drought and hunger will get worse in Africa if the
Earth's climate keeps warming.
   ``The semi-arid tropics will have even greater climatic
variability as the warming continues,'' he said.
   ``The industrialized countries may do more for Africa in the long
run by helping to reduce global warming than by supplying short-term
aid, however welcome that is at the time.
   ``We would prefer to prevent droughts altogether rather than have
to learn to deal with them well.''
   The warming of the Earth and its lower atmosphere is caused by
trapped solar radiation.
   The other Africa Prize-winner, Ouedraogo, has organized about
500,000 peasants in nine countries in Africa to develop their
villages based on traditional cooperative village leadership.
   The villagers in Burkina Faso, Chad, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Mali,
Mauritania, Niger, Senegal and Togo raise vegetables, learn new
farming techniques, improve literacy, fight erosion, replant
forests, build roads and improve health care.
   The Africa Prize consists of $100,000 and a statue, awarded by
the New York-based Hunger Project.
   Ouedraogo said he will ask the peasant farmers he has organized
how they would like to use his share of the prize.
   Masire also said he would distribute his share of the award to
grass-roots organizers and villagers who made Botswana's victory
over famine possible.
