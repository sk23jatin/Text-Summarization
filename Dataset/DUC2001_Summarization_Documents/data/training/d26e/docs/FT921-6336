FT  28 FEB 92 / S Africa drought 'may hit economic growth figures'

THE effects of widespread drought on grain production in South Africa could
negate the expected recovery in economic growth in the second half of the
year, Mr Kraai van Niekerk, the country's agriculture minister, said
yesterday.
Mr Barend du Plessis, the finance minister, had been expecting the
recession-hit economy to expand by 1.5 per cent this year. However, Mr van
Niekerk said: ' As a result of agriculture's low production in summer
rainfall areas, there is a great possibility the expected growth rate could
be practically obliterated in the second half of 1992.'
His predictions followed warnings on Wednesday that drought in southern
Africa could cause famine in much of the region.
The United Nations Food and Agriculture organisation said hot and dry
conditions in January and February were expected to reduce the total cereal
harvest in 11 southern African countries to 16m tonnes, 25 per cent down on
the average.
It said Zimbabwe and South Africa, which normally offset shortages in the
area with their own surpluses, would themselves have to import food.
Other than these two countries, Mozambique and Zambia were likely to be most
seriously affected.
The FAO said that as much as 2m tonnes of food aid could be needed for
southern Africa this year. Total food imports for the region could be as
high as 6m tonnes, three times more than in a normal year.
Logistical constraints could further exacerbate the problem, the FAO said,
with port handling capacities stretched by unprecedentedly large cereal
imports and neighbouring countries sometimes competing for limited rail
wagons.
It said meeting food aid needs could be difficult as international attention
was focused on emergencies in the former Soviet Union, eastern Europe, Iraq
and the Horn of Africa.
