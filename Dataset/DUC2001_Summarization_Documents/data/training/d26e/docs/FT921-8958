'Only God can help us through this crisis,' said the Afrikaner preacher
called to provide spiritual guidance to South Africa's farmers, who have
been hit by one of the worst droughts in living memory.
Indeed, in the eastern Transvaal town of Bethal, where Dominee Nel was
delivering his sermon at a farmers' meeting earlier this week, elderly
residents say this drought is the worst since 1933. Mr JG Wilson of the
local agricultural co-operative says maize farmers in the area - one of the
largest maize producing regions - have already lost 80 to 100 per cent of
their crops.
Agricultural economists point out that drought years are more the norm in
South Africa than the exception. But Mr Koos du Toit, chief economist of the
South African Agricultural Union, says it is the worst drought he has ever
seen, and the most widespread. Farmers who produce maize, South Africa's
staple food, will be the hardest hit, with stock farmers also at risk. Mr du
Toit endorses comparisons with 1933, a highly emotive year for Afrikaners
because of the numbers forced off the land by drought.
The Maize Board, the state marketing board, expects a crop of 4m tonnes,
though Mr du Toit believes it could be closer to 3m or 3.5m, which would
make it the worst harvest in 50 years. The board expects to import 2m to 3m
tonnes of maize for local consumption, at a cost of R1.5bn. Mr du Toit
believes imports could hit 3.5m.
Government, for its part, has said that it will act to prevent farmers
leaving the land this time - although it has little room for manoeuvre,
given the fragility of the country's political transition, the depressed
economy and the demands of blacks for a fairer share of government spending.
None the less, Pretoria is understood to be contemplating substantial
drought aid for farmers: several hundred million rands, or perhaps as much
as R1bn (Pounds 200m) over two to three years. Without such aid, the Maize
Board estimates that some 2,000 to 3,000 of the 17,000 maize farmers could
be forced off the land this year, victims of high interest rates, high input
costs, and excessive debt, with drought just administering the coup de
grace.
Given the ruling National Party's current unpopularity among whites -
especially farmers, who are traditionally ultra-conservative - this could
prove a serious political blow to the reform process.
But the alternative - numerous bankruptcies - could have a serious knock-on
effect in several areas. Farm labourers, most of them black, could lose
their jobs; with about 1m employed in farming overall, this could be a
severe problem. Businesses in rural towns are already suffering and more
could fold because of drought.
Millions of black subsistence farmers will also be victims of drought, with
the charity Operation Hunger warning that hunger could turn to starvation
soon in many rural areas.
Farmers say abnormally low rainfall and unusually high daytime temperatures
have just compounded the already precarious financial situation of many.
They complain of deteriorating terms of trade, noting that an imported
tractor which cost the equivalent of 191 tonnes of maize in 1985, had risen
to cost the equivalent of 347 tonnes by 1989-90.
Farm debt is another serious problem, with farmers struggling to repay debts
of nearly R16bn at interest rates of over 20 per cent. Low agricultural
output will depress overall economic activity, slowing South Africa's
recovery from a three-year recession. Real gross domestic product has been
forecast to rise by 1.5 per cent this year, though that figure could prove
much too optimistic if the worst drought predictions are borne out.
