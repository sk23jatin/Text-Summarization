The history of drought and famine in Africa is repeating itself.  More
than 27 million people are facing starvation in southern Africa and in
the Horn area.

The hunger problem has been complicated by the refusal of some African
governments to supply food to areas controlled by rebel factions.
Food supplies have also been hijacked.

Donor countries are becoming hard-pressed to meet food requests.

Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Zambia and South Africa are in the most serious
condition.  Other countries facing starvation are: Sudan, Ethiopia,
Somalia, Djibouti and Malawi.

Some countries encounter problems in the distribution of imported food
supplies because of lack of rail and port facilities.

South Africa's older generation remembers the drought of 1992 as the
worst since 1933.  That drought forced farmers off the land, something
the government says will not recur.

In Zimbabwe, farmers are totaling the losses from the worst drought in
its history.  Rainfall has been half its norm.  Maize production is 90
percent less than normal.

The water shortage is also having a severe effect on electric power
production.

The president of Botswana, Quett Masire, believes that industrial
nations can assist in reducing Africa's drought by decreasing global
warning.  </SUM>
