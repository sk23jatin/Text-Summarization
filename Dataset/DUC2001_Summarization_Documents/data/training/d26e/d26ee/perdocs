There is an extensive history of drought and famine in Africa and it
is continuing. Twenty-seven million people are now facing famine.

Millions have died. Some governments have refused relief supplies for
portions of their countries under rebel control, thus increasing
famine deaths.

U.S. donations to Africa run into the millions. Because of the
enormity of the problem, donor countries have difficulty in keeping up
with requests.

The U.S. is debating about attaching strings to aid. Military forces
in Africa have seized some food supplies for themselves and these
forces keep the governments in power.  </SUM>

International experts are being sent to southern Africa to assess the
effects of a severe drought on food supplies. Ten drought-stricken
countries are affected with Zimbabwe and South Africa in the most
severe condition.

These two countries, normally food exporters, must now import
substantial amounts of grain. It has been described as the worst
drought of the century, with about 15 million people at
risk. Additionally, the northeast of Africa, including Sudan,
Ethiopia, Somalia, and Djibouti, has also felt the drought.

The U.S. State Department believes that a huge donor assistance
program will be needed to avoid the crisis.  </SUM>

Malawi has been added to the list of countries requiring the import of
food following crop failure in 1994-95.

Malawi needs the import of food for three million people.

Some of the imported food will be used in the market to stabilize
supply and prices. This would prevent riots, hoarding, and extreme
prices, all of which occurred during the 1992 famine.

Malawi has not yet recovered from the 1991-1992 drought. Malnutrition
rates are high, particularly among children.

Malawi is landlocked but it did not have any problems in the
distribution of imported food during the previous drought and
famine. </SUM>

South Africa's drought could adversely affect grain production and
cancel out the expected recovery in economic growth, according to the
country's agricultural minister. He predicted earlier that hot and dry
conditions in southern Africa could cause widespread famine.

The United Nations Food and Agriculture organization said that the
expected shortfall would be four million tons.

Of the countries facing famine, Mozambique and Zambia, in addition to 
Zimbabwe and South Africa, were the most in danger. 

The countries facing famine do not have adequate rail and port
facilities, complicating the distribution of food to needed areas.

The older generation of South Africa's farmers say that the drought of
1992 is the worst since 1933.

Especially hard hit are the farmers who produce South Africa's main
crop, maize; stock farmers are also badly affected.

In 1933, drought forced farmers off their land. The state says that it
will prevent this from happening this time.

Imports of food could reach record levels, thereby compounding the
deficit problem. Unemployment caused by the drought, a depressed
economy and flat growth rate could add significantly to the state's
dilemma.  </SUM>

Prieska is a desert farming community in northern South Africa's Cape
Province. It was the site of Friday's annual agricultural show.

South Africa's minister of agriculture is also a farmer. Kraii van
Niekerk was campaigning in his constituency. He was trying to convince
his fellow farmers to continue political reform and adopt his own
farming techniques because of the drought.

His platform is one of minimizing the number of farmers going bankrupt
by offering loans, writing off debt and obtaininig subsidies.

To permit a large number of farms to fail would result in
unemployment, thus exasperating the food problem.  </SUM>

Farmers are taking stock in Zimbabwe. They are totaling losses in the
face of the worst drought they have ever experienced. Rainfall in 1992
has been less than half the usual amount.

The production of maize, a staple crop, is about 90 percent less than
normal.  Soybeans, winter wheat and cotton production is a fraction of
the usual totals.  Only drought-resistant tobacco is at normal
levels. Farm production for 1992 has decreased to the lowest level in
30 years.

Zimbabwe needs 350 million dollars worth of imported food. Water
shortages are having a serious effect on electric power
production. </SUM>

According to President Quett Masire of Botswana, industrial nations
can assist in relieving Africa's drought and subsequent hunger by
making a greater effort at reducing global warming. Masire and
Dr. Bernard Ledea Ouedraogo, an anti-hunger organizer in Burkina Faso,
were awarded the 1988 Africa Prize for Leadership for their
anti-hunger efforts.

Although a severe drought afflicted Africa from 1981 to 1987, not one
person in Botswana died of drought-induced famine.

Dr. Ouedraogo, the other prizewinner, organized the peasants in nine
African countries. As a result, new crop-raising techniques were
learned, erosion was checked, forests replanted and health care
improved.  </SUM>
