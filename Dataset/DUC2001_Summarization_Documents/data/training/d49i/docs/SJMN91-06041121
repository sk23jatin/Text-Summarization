<LEADPARA>  Along the hushed, marble corridors of the Federal Reserve Board's graceful old
headquarters building, fears of war and recession seem far away -- except
inside the second-floor office occupied by Alan Greenspan.;    In his private
lair, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board is decidedly on a wartime
footing.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  GREENSPAN'S CAPITAL GAINS
FED CHIEF'S ROLE HAS CHANGED FROM SCAPEGOAT
TO WHITE HOUSE CONFIDANT  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     With his television set tuned to Cable News Network, a phone line open to
the White House and an aide poised by his elbow to provide the latest economic
statistics, Greenspan is playing the role of wartime Washington policy-maker
to the hilt.;    Indeed, unlike his predecessor, the prickly and standoffish
Paul A. Volcker, Greenspan has developed close ties to the White House and has
quietly become a key economic adviser to President Bush.;    Greenspan's
influence over White House economic policy became clear during President
Bush's State of the Union address, when Bush announced that he was tapping
Greenspan to lead a new commission to study a controversial proposal to cut
the tax rate for capital gains.;    The appointment will plunge Greenspan --
himself a strong supporter of a cut in capital gains tax rates -- directly
into the middle of a raging political debate between the president and
Congress over tax policy.;    By any standard, Fed-watchers say Greenspan is
taking on a role that is almost unprecedented in modern times. Most say they
cannot recall any time the Fed chief has been asked to step so directly into
the middle of such a political controversy.;    "Whenever there are major
economic decisions to be made, (Greenspan) is in on them," a delighted Fed
official said. "His voice is listened to.";    But even before his new capital
gains study begins, it is clear Greenspan has chosen to side with the
administration in the battle over fiscal policy. Soon after the war began, the
Fed chairman signaled he planned to cut interest rates further in order to
ease the credit crunch that seems to be prolonging the economic slump.;    On
Feb. 1, he moved decisively, chopping the Fed's key discount rate to 6 percent
from 6.5 percent. It was the second time in six weeks Greenspan had turned to
this key anti-recession weapon, the heaviest in the Fed's arsenal.;    While
such actions may be justified on economic grounds, they also conveniently jibe
with what the administration wants from the Fed. Secretary of the Treasury
Nicholas Brady, who frequently criticized Greenspan last year for not moving
quickly enough, has been noticeably silent on Fed policy.;    Greenspan's
responsiveness on interest rates, his apparent eagerness to join the
administration's fight on capital gains -- and Bush's decision to place the
capital gains issue in his hands -- show just how close Greenspan's relations
with the White House have become.;    It also may signal that Greenspan, who
will turn 65 in March, is almost certain to be reappointed as chairman when
his current term expires next summer.;    Indeed, Fed-watchers say the only
parallel in history to Greenspan's close relations with the White House came
in the days of another wartime central banker, Mariner S. Eccles, the Fed
chairman who stood beside President Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War
II.;    "I think Bush is turning more and more to him for economic advice,"
says Lawrence Kudlow, an economist and senior managing director at Bear
Stearns in New York. "There seems to be a real interesting power shift going
on, with Greenspan becoming more and more influential.";    It wasn't always
that way. During most of Bush's first two years in office, the administration
and the Fed chairman were virtually in a state of war.;    Brady and White
House Chief of Staff John Sununu criticized him repeatedly for refusing to
push interest rates down -- a move Greenspan insisted might send interest
rates even higher by making financial markets fearful that the Fed was
abandoning the inflation fight.;    There were even some hints that Bush had
decided not to reappoint Greenspan to the Fed chairmanship. Some close to the
president reported that he had all but announced that to intimates in
mid-1990.;    Yet now, with the war under way at a time when the recession has
yet to abate, Greenspan finds himself trying to perform an increasingly
difficult balancing act.;    At the same time he is seeking to be a player in
setting White House policy, he must also guide the Fed through an economic
minefield -- the booby-traps of war, recession, bank failures, soaring budget
deficits and crashing consumer confidence.;    Clearly, Greenspan, a longtime
Washington insider with good political instincts, hopes to keep economic
policy in sync with the nation's military strategy -- hoping to calm both the
financial markets and the public in order to help keep the wartime economy
stable.;    But critics are cautious about charging that Greenspan is
politicizing the Fed in any way.;    "It is hard to know whether he is
accommodating the White House or if this is just the sensible thing to do,"
says Allan Meltzer, an economist at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh
and a longtime Fed-watcher.;    Moreover, even if he wants to please the White
House, Greenspan still can't appear overly eager to loosen the Fed's reins. He
must still appease the hard-liners within the Fed who remain concerned about
inflation.;    As a result, critics have noticed gleefully that Greenspan --
uncharacteristically, Fed-watchers say -- has made some seemingly conflicting
statements on the direction of interest rates and monetary policy in recent
weeks.;    "I've noticed a real change in the message from one day to the
next," Meltzer says.;    Still, most analysts believe that, despite the
confusing message, Greenspan is now solidly in favor of easing interest rates
further -- a position that clearly has made him more welcome at the White
House.;    Observers note that Greenspan, who ran his own economic consulting
firm before coming to the Fed to replace Volcker in 1987, is ideally suited to
the role of gray eminence -- of a senior behind-the-scenes adviser.;    In
fact, he played such a role on a more official basis during the Ford
administration, when he served as the president's chief economic adviser.;   
It was during the Ford administration in the mid-1970s that Greenspan first
came to know Bush, who served in a series of posts under Ford, including
director of the Central Intelligence Agency.;    "That's really his forte,
providing one-on-one advice," says Robert Kavesh, an economics professor at
New York University and a Greenspan friend since they were college classmates
at New York University in the late 1940s.;    "He's a low-key guy who is at
his best in a private situations where he can quietly exchange views. And I
think Bush is someone who is open to that kind of advice."  </TEXT>
