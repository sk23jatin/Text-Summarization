In his youth, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, was a
disciple of Ayn Rand, the ultra right-wing American novelist and philosopher
who stressed the moral, as opposed to economic, virtues of full-blown
capitalism.
According to Time magazine, in an article for Rand's journal the
Objectivist, Mr Greenspan once argued that the welfare state was 'nothing
more than a mechanism by which governments confiscate the wealth of the
productive members of society'. This was probably just youthful indiscretion
but Mr Greenspan is now having to adapt to an intellectual climate far
removed from Rand's social Darwinism.
This is not proving all that difficult. Mr Greenspan has always drawn a
sharp distinction between his private views and his duties as a public
servant. Although appointed to the Fed in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan,
he has never been publicly associated with radical conservatism. Having
served in the mid-1970s as chairman of Gerald Ford's Council of Economic
Advisers, he is seen as a moderate Republican. At the Fed he has built a
reputation for non-partisan professionalism; only the odd hint of his
personal philosophy emerges, as, for example, in his opposition to any form
of capital gains tax.
President Bill Clinton and Mr Greenspan are circling each other warily. Mr
Clinton has stressed his support for the Fed's independence; Mr Greenspan
has promised to co-operate with the White House and has publicly praised the
president's deficit-cutting plan. However, as one of the few remaining
conservatives with real power, Mr Greenspan has become a target for
congressional Democrats. In recent hearings, he was denounced for failing to
cut interest rates quickly enough during the recession and for refusing to
pledge further easing of monetary policy in response to fresh efforts to
curb the deficit.
At times, as senators adopted the sarcastic tone of prosecuting attorneys,
the hearings took on an almost surreal aspect. Oblivious to encouraging data
(such as growth at an annual rate of 3.8 per cent in the fourth quarter), Mr
Paul Sarbanes of Maryland acted as if the Fed chief were on trial for crimes
against the state. When Mr Greenspan had the temerity to defend his record,
the prosecutor reeled off the names of eminent economists - such as Nobel
prize-winners Milton Friedman, James Tobin and Paul Samuelson - who had
publicly criticised him for doing 'too little too late'.
The attack on Mr Greenspan's economic competence was wholly unjustified.
With hindsight he has navigated treacherous economic seas with great skill.
He courageously raised interest rates in the late 1980s, thereby setting in
motion disinflationary forces. But he was sensitive to the risk of a
1930s-style financial meltdown and subsequently brought rates down faster
than conventional wisdom abroad (although not at home) thought desirable,
thus laying the ground for a quite vigorous recovery.
Of course, Mr Greenspan's curriculum vitae does not compare with those of
armchair theorists such as Friedman, Tobin and Samuelson. He has published
little and was finally awarded a PhD by New York University only in 1977 -
after he had served three years as chief economist under President Ford.
Indeed, by the silly standards applied to Mr Clinton's appointees, Mr
Greenspan was not qualified to be CEA chairman. Instead of seeking a
university chair, young Mr Greenspan founded his own Wall Street consultancy
and spent decades analysing the minutia of business cycles, in the process
gaining more practical wisdom than half a dozen professors.
Having handled the recession adroitly, he now faces even tougher challenges.
With inflationary pressures still low and the economy only just beginning to
gather momentum, monetary policy is currently tight enough. But if Mr
Greenspan wants to be remembered as the first Fed chairman for a generation
to secure something approaching price stability, he may need to raise
short-term interest rates substantially in coming years, certainly by 1995.
The scene is thus set for a bitter tussle of power with the Clinton
administration, which is unlikely to be enthusiastic about a sharp
tightening of monetary policy ahead of the next election.
Yet there is a more insidious threat. Since the US has never suffered a
hyperinflation, there is little popular support for Fed independence. Some
of Democrats are pressing for legislation that would increase Congress's
leverage over monetary policy. Democrats have long been unhappy about the
role played by the presidents of the Fed's regional branches. Often
monetarist by inclination, the regional presidents have five of the 12 votes
on the Federal Open Market Committee (the body that determines the level of
short-term interest rates). Yet, unlike Washington-based Fed governors, they
are not selected by the White House or subject to congressional
confirmation.
Mr Clinton may mean what he says about Fed independence. But if the
electoral cycle proves more important, Mr Greenspan and his board (all
Reagan/Bush appointees) will face a painful dilemma. If the Fed resists
pressure for expansionary monetary policies, it may end up subject to
greater political control; if it does not, it risks higher inflation. It is
not an inspiring outlook for a man who prefers crunching data to playing
political poker.
