   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan,
looking back on his work for Lincoln Savings and Loan Association,
says he doesn't believe he could have foreseen the thrift's
spectacular failure, expected to be the costliest in the nation's
history.
   Nearly five years ago, Greenspan testified before Congress as a
private consultant and lobbied regulators on behalf of Lincoln and
its owner, Phoenix, Ariz., millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr.
   Keating objected to federal regulations restricting thrift
institutions' direct investments in real estate development.
Greenspan, a conservative economist generally opposed to government
meddling in business, supported him.
   In an interview last week, Greenspan said he was surprised and
distressed by Lincoln's eventual failure because of sour real
estate deals. But he said he still supports short-term direct
investments when thrifts are exposed to interest rate risks.
   Supporters of direct investments have long argued that they can
benefit S&amp;Ls struggling with a portfolio of long-term mortgages.
   ``I look back and I say to myself, `Was there something I should
have seen and didn't see?' and the answer is, `There was nothing
visible _ at least to me,''' Greenspan said.
   In early 1985, Irvine, Calif.-based Lincoln was a fast-growing
institution under aggressive managers who eschewed traditional
home-mortgage lending. Greenspan was a private economist with
impressive political credentials as President Ford's chief economic
adviser a decade earlier.
   Now, Lincoln is insolvent and under government control.
Regulators say it will cost taxpayers $2 billion to protect its
depositors, making it the nation's largest S&amp;L failure.
   Greenspan is no longer a private consultant and, suddenly, his
five-year-old statements loom large. As chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board, he is considered by many to be, after the president,
the most powerful official in the nation. The Fed influences daily
life, perhaps more than any other government agency, through its
manipulation of the economy and credit.
   In a Feb. 13, 1985, letter to the Federal Home Loan Bank of San
Francisco, Greenspan argued that Lincoln deserved an exemption from
regulations limiting to 10 percent thrifts' direct investment in
real estate and other commercial ventures.
   Lincoln's management, he said, was ``seasoned and expert in
selecting and making direct investments'' with ``a long and
continuous track record of outstanding success.'' The institution
itself was ``financially strong,'' in a ``vibrant and healthy
state'' and ``present(ed) no foreseeable risk to the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.,'' he said.
   Two weeks later, on Feb. 27, 1985, Greenspan told the House
Government Operations subcommittee on consumer, commerce and
monetary affairs that direct investments, while undoubtedly risky,
were essential for thrifts to diversify their holdings.
   Traditional S&amp;Ls, which took in short-term deposits and made
long-term mortgage loans, were vulnerable to a sharp rise in
interest rates and direct investments were a valuable alternative,
he said.
   He also endorsed a study by economist George Bentsen, now with
Emory University, which cited the success of 17 S&amp;Ls in direct
investments. Fifteen of the 17 have since failed.
   ``It was my view then, as it is now, that interest rate risk was
the crucial problem confronting S&amp;Ls _ the problem of long-term
assets financed by short-term deposits. In that particular context,
at that particular time, direct investment would reduce risk,'' he
said.
   Greenspan still believes Bentsen took a ``rather sensible
statistical approach'' but he points out that most of the 17 S&amp;Ls
cited in his study were located in Texas, later the center of the
oil and real estate bust.
   The central bank chairman's views have been cited as one of the
reasons why a petition, calling on S&amp;L regulators to postpone
direct investment limits, attracted 225 signatures in the House in
early 1985.
   It is also being cited as a reason why, two years later, five
senators decided to intervene with S&amp;L regulators after Keating
complained about their efforts to examine Lincoln's finances.
   The five _ Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.;
Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.; John Glenn, D-Ohio, and John McCain,
R-Ariz. _ met with the regulators in April 1987.
   Two of them _ Cranston and McCain _ said Greenspan's views on
Lincoln's health heavily influenced their thinking.
   ``The problem, as conveyed to me at the time, not only by Mr.
Keating but also by Mr. Greenspan and Arthur Young &amp; Co. (an
accounting firm) was that federal examiners bore substantial
responsibility for creating a most destructive and irrational state
of limbo for this institution,'' Cranston told the Senate Ethics
Committee in a Nov. 16 letter.
   Greenspan said he does not understand why the senators cite his
opinion as a reason for actions taken so long after it was given.
   ``You do not rely on a 2{-year-old letter unless you call the
guy who wrote it. No one ever called me,'' he said.
   Greenspan, as president of Townsend Greenspan &amp; Co., was hired
to review Lincoln's condition by the New York law firm of Paul
Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison. He said he could not remember
how much he was paid for his work, but said he charged his usual
hourly rate.
   The partners of the law firm, he said, were long-time, trusted
associates. ``They certainly never gave me the slightest impression
that these were other than good people'' at Lincoln.
   Greenspan said he recalls meeting Keating himself two or three
times, but never for a detailed, analytical discussion. The people
working under Keating ``frankly I found fairly impressive,'' he
said.
