Yesterday President Reagan announced that he would nominate Alan Greenspan, 
61, to replace Paul Volcker as chief of the nation's central bank.  Reactions in Congress 
and Wall Street have been mixed.  Mr. Greenspan headed the Council of Economic 
Advisers under President Ford.  Greenspan currently heads Townsend-Greenspan Co, an 
economic consulting firm. He helped shore-up the Social Security system in 1983 and 
negotiated on Ford's behalf at the 1980 Republican Convention.  Greenspan is a foe of 
inflation and supply-side economics, and supports cutting the federal budget deficit. He is 
unmarried and enjoys socializing, including playing musical instruments at parties.  He 
has a dry sense of humor and excellent press relations.

Opinions differ on how strong Alan Greenspan will be as Chairman of the Federal 
Reserve.  He has close ties to the traditional wing of the Republican Party and is 
considered anti-supply-side.  He has been called "a good consensus builder," a skill 
needed to manage the majority supply-side Reserve board.  He shares Reagan's pro-
deregulation views on banking issues and has excellent relations with White House Chief 
of Staff Howard Baker and Treasury Secretary James Baker.  However, he must keep 
enough distance from the White House to avoid compromising the Fed's independence or 
drawing Congressional interference.

The Senate overwhelmingly approved the appointment of economist Alan 
Greenspan to become chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, a position called the 
second most powerful in the country.  Only two senators, Conrad of North Dakota and 
Bradley of New Jersey--both Democrats, voted against the appointment.  Greenspan, 
who headed the Council of Economic Advisers under President Ford, has considerable 
knowledge and experience.  He has developed a reputation as an inflation-fighter.  He is 
in a position to influence monetary policy and affect the economy's performance over the 
next four years.

Alan Greenspan's caution as Federal Reserve Chairman has become legendary.  
He fusses extensively over economic statistics, always seeking more information.  He 
failed to make any announcement after the October 13 stock market plunge, claiming that 
he wanted to see what happened on Monday morning.  On Monday, the central bank took 
only modest steps to aid the markets and by the end of the week the federal funds interest 
rate dropped only .25%.  So far this caution had served the nation well, but there are fears 
that the Fed's reluctance to ease credit could lay the groundwork for a new recession, 
perhaps starting early next year.

Alan Greenspan doesn't believe he could have foreseen the spectacular failure of 
the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association.  In early 1985, Greenspan testified before 
Congress on behalf of the Lincoln and its owner Charles H. Keating Jr.  Keating objected 
to federal regulations restricting thrift institutions' direct investments in real estate 
development and Greenspan supported him, arguing that Lincoln's management had a 
long track record of success, and deserved the exemption.  He also endorsed a study 
citing success in direct investments of 17 savings and loans.  Fifteen of these firms have 
failed.  Several legislators cited Greenspan's support as a reason they intervened with 
Savings and Loan regulators.

Blame-shifters are making Alan Greenspan and his Federal Reserve scapegoats in 
the current recession.  Some are opposing his reappointment to a new four-year term in 
August.  Other potential candidates do not appear ready for the job and Greenspan has 
become Bush's biggest economic asset.  Bushes economic advisers and Congress who 
raised taxes three months into a recession are now expecting the Fed's to ease money 
supply and lower short-term interest rates.  If the recession persists too long, the solution 
may lie in a cut to capital-gains taxes, strongly recommended by Greenspan.  His main 
defenders are the financial markets and the American middle class.

No decision has been made on the fate of Alan Greenspan, but administration 
officials say efforts to depose him will probably fail.  He is well regarded in financial 
markets and the Fed chief is considered a Wall Street call.  Although Bush's top 
economic advisers have complaints about Greenspan, they have no replacement they all 
could support.   Bush considers Greenspan a friend and adviser.   Greenspan has not 
made an impression on the general public and a majority (59%) has no opinion on his 
reappointment.  He has drawn high praise from academics, although his own academic 
work is obscure.  His 1977 dissertation cannot be found.

Alan Greenspan, 64, has become a key economic advisor to President Bush, who 
has named him to lead a commission to study a proposal to cut the tax rate on capital 
gains. Greenspan has cut the Federal Reserve's key discount rate twice in the last 6 
weeks.  While these cuts are justified on economic grounds, they also agree with 
economic goals of the Bush administration. Greenspan must guide the Fed through the 
concurrent crises of the war, recession, bank failures, budget deficits, and crashing 
consumer confidence.  For the first 2 years the Bush administration was virtually at war 
with Greenspan, but Fed-watchers now expect him to be reappointed.

The expected reappointment of Alan Greenspan at Federal Reserve Board 
Chairman has not occurred.  His current appointment ends on August 11, creating a very 
tight schedule.  Bush and his advisers have often criticized the Fed but no acceptable 
candidate has surfaced.  Greenspan holds the confidence of the financial community and 
few economists blame the recession, underway since July 1990, on him. The 
announcement of the appointment could be delayed until after he testifies on the central 
bank's economic outlook for the rest of the year at the Humphrey-Hawkins hearing. If 
reappointed Greenspan would have another round of confirmation hearings before the 
Senate Banking Committee, but these also could be delayed.

Alan Greenspan, presently seen as a moderate Republican, has a past tied to more 
conservative philosophies, including those of social Darwinist Ayn Rand.  He and 
President Clinton are circling each other warily.  Clinton has stressed his support for the 
Fed's independence and Greenspan has promised to cooperate with the White House, 
praising its deficit-cutting plan.  Although criticized during the recession, he successfully 
avoided a depression and laid the groundwork for a vigorous recovery.  Greenspan is not 
an academic.  He received his Ph.D. only after serving 3 years as chief economist for 
President Ford.  He then founded a Wall Street consulting company, analyzing the 
minutia of business cycles for decades.

Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan, a former disciple of ultra-libertarian 
author Ayn Rand, is courting the Clintons, who are beginning to value his economic 
advice.  He even termed the administration's deficit-cutting measures as "credible."  
Greenspan maintains a low profile in Washington, although he is dating NBC reporter 
Andrea Mitchell.  He apparently considers the task of the central bank to be promoting 
economic growth as well as the controlling inflation.  He successfully maneuvered 
through the recession with many, small, interest cuts, but as the US economy flourishes 
he is being criticized for his gradual interest increases.  Greenspan still has the respect of 
Wall Street and no credible successor for 1996 has yet appeared.
