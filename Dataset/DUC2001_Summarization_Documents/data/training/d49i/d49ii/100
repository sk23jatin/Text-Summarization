From 1987 to 1994, Alan Greenspan successfully maneuvered through
three administrations as Chairman of the United States Federal Reserve
Bank.  Many have called this position the second most powerful in the
country.  Greenspan, born in 1926, was in the government in the 1970's
then headed a Wall Street consulting firm for decades.  Greenspan is
considered a moderate Republican.  He is considered anti-supply- side,
anti-inflation, anti-capital gains tax, and anti-budget deficit.  He
cautiously led the economy with gradual changes in the interest rate,
controlling the cash flow but gently stimulating the economy when
necessary.  He maintained the Fed's independence from White House and
Congressional interference.  </SUM>
