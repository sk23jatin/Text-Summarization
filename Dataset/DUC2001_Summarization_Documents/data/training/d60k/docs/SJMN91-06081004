<LEADPARA>  As Rodney G. King was beaten by Los Angeles Police officers on March 3, other
officers seized one of King's passengers, Bryant Allen, who says he was
manhandled and taunted in a racially motivated attempt to provoke him.;    In
an interview, Allen said he feared for his life as he was made to crawl along
the ground, hearing at the same time his friend's screams and the sounds of
police batons from the far side of the car.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "He was screaming, 'Stop!' " said Allen, who said he heard but did not see
his friend being beaten. "Then he kind of quit, and all you could hear was
like bones being broken, a crunching, like a whip sound.";    In the first
complete account of the incident from one who was there, Allen, 25, said he
believed the beating of King and the blows directed at him and a second
passenger, Freddie Helms, were racially motivated.;    All three men in the
car were black. The police officers were white. As many as 21 Los Angeles
police officers were present; a sergeant and three officers have been indicted
on assault charges.;    Allen's lawyer, John C. Burton, said he would file a
federal civil rights suit. King's lawyer said Tuesday he also would file a
suit. None of the three men in the car has been charged.;    Allen tapped his
foot slowly as he sat with his lawyer Tuesday night, watching for the first
time the full seven-minute videotape, which includes the two-minute beating
that has been shown repeatedly on national television.;    The videotape has
led to calls for the resignation of Chief Daryl F. Gates and prompted
inquiries into the extent of police brutality nationwide.;    Speaking
quietly, Allen described King's erratic behavior behind the wheel on a night
when the three men had been drinking beer and said tension was heightened when
King had trouble with his seat belt as he was complying with police orders to
leave his car.;    He said that at one point a female officer intervened when
he himself was threatened with violence. "She's the one who had her hand out
saying I didn't do anything wrong," Allen recalled. She was saying, 'He's the
one that had his hands up.' ";    Nevertheless, he said, he was kicked and
manhandled, and Allen said he was threatened by officers who said: "You want
to be like your home boy? You want to be like your home boy?";    When the
beating was over, the police officers left him and Helms standing by the side
of the road, he said. "They said, 'Guess what?' I said, 'What?' They said,
'You're in a Crips neighborhood.' They laughed and took off.";    Allen said
he and his friends, all unemployed, came from a neighborhood claimed by the
Bloods, a rival to the Crips gang.;    Since the incident, he said, he had
spoken twice with King, 25, who suffered multiple fractures and what his
lawyer said may be permanent brain damage. King initially declined to
characterize the incident as racial.;    On his recent visits, he said, King
was having difficulty remembering the night of the beating in a coherent way.
"It sounded like he was talking in riddles, all mixed up," Allen said.;    As
Allen recalls it, the late-night incident began with the three men speeding
down the Foothill Freeway in northern Los Angeles at what might have been as
fast as 80 miles an hour. Burton said the men had each drunk a 40-ounce bottle
of Old English 800 malt liquor.;    Burton said, "Drugs had absolutely nothing
to do with this incident." Medical tests also showed that King was free of
drugs.;    After visiting at Allen's house, King told his friends he was
taking them to a park where he had gone in the past with his father.;    When
he saw the flashing lights of a California Highway Patrol car behind them,
Allen said: "I told him, 'Rodney, pull over, stop.' He just kept on going,
kept on driving.;    "I thought he was pulling over, but he was going down the
off-ramp. We stopped at the stop sign, and then we were driving again. I said,
'Rodney, pull over.' We were still driving, and the lights were flashing. I
could hear a lot of cars." Their small white Hyundai was surrounded by police
cars and illuminated by the glare of headlights. It was at this point, he
said, that the other passenger, Helms, who had been asleep in the front seat,
woke up.;    "The police ordered us, 'Driver, put your hands out the window,"'
Allen continued. "They said, 'Take your left hand outside the door and step
out.' Rodney had the seat belt, and it kind of yanked him back. The police
were getting nervous too. They told him to lie flat down, and he lay flat
down.";    Allen said he and Helms left the car on the opposite side, beside a
large, dark park, and also lay down.;    "The police put the handcuffs on me,
and that's when I heard Rodney screaming," Allen went on. "He was screaming
like he was getting a whupping.";    After the screaming stopped, he said, he
continued to hear the whipping sound of the nightsticks through the clatter of
a hovering helicopter.  </TEXT>
