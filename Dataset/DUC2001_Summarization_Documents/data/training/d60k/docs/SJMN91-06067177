<LEADPARA>  The world reacted with sickened shock and outrage to the brutal beating of a
Southern California man by police officers, played out in painful clarity on
the screens of tens of millions of television sets this week from an amateur
cameraman's videotape.;    Some in the African-American community here reacted
with more of a shrug.  </LEADPARA>

ON L.A. POLICE
'THIS IS NOT NEWS,' SAYS BLACK RESIDENT  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>     "You talk to people in the black community here, and they say, 'This is not
news,' " said Joe Hicks, an American Civil Liberties Union spokesman who grew
up in the community. "They say, 'Why are all the white people so surprised? A
guy got his butt beat by the cops. It happens all the time.' ";    Behind the
shrug, though, emotions run deep. "There's nothing you can imagine the guy had
done that would justify that kind of response," Hicks said.;    Rodney Glen
King, the victim of the beating, on Wednesday was released from Los Angeles
County Jail after prosecutors said police had failed to prove their charges
that he resisted arrest after a high-speed chase. The officers involved in the
beating have been taken off patrol.;    Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates,
long controversial for racial statements he has made, called the brutality
depicted on the tape "an aberration.";    "Anyone who viewed this tape would
hasten to make a quick judgment," Gates said Tuesday. "I would hope the public
on this one case not make a judgment on the Los Angeles Police Department.";  
 The department issued no statements Wednesday. Agencies including the FBI,
the LAPD, Los Angeles District Attorney's Office and the California Highway
Patrol are investigating the beating. A city councilman also has asked for a
council committee review of the larger issue of police brutality throughout
the city.;    The stunning videotape was recorded by George Holliday, a
plumber who was awakened about 12:30 a.m. Sunday in his suburban Los Angeles
home by the sound of police helicopters overhead. Holliday went to the terrace
of his second-story apartment and, seeing police in the street below, decided
to get some practice with his new videotape recorder.;    Holliday took the
tape to a local television station, which aired it Monday night and passed it
along to the Cable News Network. By Tuesday night, the horrifying images had
been piped into more than 30 million homes: There, the 25-year-old King was
lying on the ground, struggling to his hands and knees, then writhing on the
ground under a hail of police night sticks and kicks. Witnesses said police
also used a stun gun on King. Three or four officers had at King in the
two-minute tape, while as many as seven others stood by to watch. King is
black. The races and identities of the police officers involved have not been
revealed.;    King, who had been released from jail in December after serving
2 1/2 years on a second-degree robbery conviction, had been pursued to the
spot outside Holliday's apartment by CHP and Los Angeles officers in a chase
police said reached speeds over 110 mph. Before his release Wednesday, the
father of two reportedly lay in the county jail's hospital ward with a broken
jaw, broken leg, disfigured face and badly bruised body.;    "When I saw it on
TV, I thought, 'Is this something happening in South Africa or Kuwait?' " said
Keith Huling, 35, who lives in the same apartment complex as Holliday. "Then I
looked a little closer, and said, 'Hey, that's the park across the street.' ";
   Police have said King resisted arrest. Witnesses have said he did not.;   
Huling said he knows of other police beatings that he believes are racially
motivated. A prevailing sense in his neighborhood this week, he said, is that
"if I come home from work and make a turn on a red light, I'm going to get my
butt kicked.";    The perception that non-Anglos are the targets of police
brutality has been chronic here.;    "Whether that's a perception or a reality
is almost beside the point, because the perception is the reality," said Zev
Yaroslavsky, the councilman who has requested public hearings on brutality
throughout the city. "I am troubled by the fact that when I learned the person
beaten was black, I wasn't surprised. . . . It is rare that there's an Anglo
that gets the crap beat out of him with a billy club.";    Yaroslavsky pointed
to recent incidents of harassment of black people. Just last December,
businessman and former Laker Jamaal Wilkes was handcuffed during a routine
traffic stop. The police department's subsequent apology to him came on the
heels of a federal jury award of $540,000 to former major league baseball
player Joe Morgan, who said Los Angeles police in 1988 had grabbed him by the
neck, thrown him to the ground and cuffed him at Los Angeles International
Airport when they thought he was a drug courier.;    Last year, 55 residents
of one of the city's streets accepted a $3 million settlement for damages from
a 1988 police drug raid in which officers allegedly wrecked apartments and
beat several people.;    "I don't think the body politic in Los Angeles has
been willing to address it," Yaroslavsky said. "But what the public has seen
in black and white, no pun intended, leaves nothing to the imagination, leaves
nothing to interpretation, (and) probably is the one event that may sensitize"
the politicians.;    The Police Misconduct Lawyer Referral Service so far this
year has received 531 complaints of police misconduct, including 127 involving
officers in the LAPD, according to Karol Heppe, the non-profit organization's
executive director. The total number of complaints is 75 percent higher than
it was at this time last year, Heppe said.;    The complaints range from
illegal search and seizure to verbal abuse to death, Heppe said. Most do not
lead to prosecution.;    "The only difference between those and this one is
that this one was caught on videotape," she said.;    Heppe lamented that the
Los Angeles police chief's attitude does not enhance the department's
reputation. Among the racial controversies he has stirred was the suggestion
that blacks die in choke holds because they have abnormal necks.;    The
ACLU's Hicks said the organization plans today to ask for Gates' resignation.  </TEXT>
