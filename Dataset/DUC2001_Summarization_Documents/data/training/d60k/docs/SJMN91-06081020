<LEADPARA>  Motorist Rodney King's night of terror at the hands of baton-wielding officers
began with California Highway Patrol officers flagging him down and promising
that he wouldn't be hurt if he stopped.;    It ended in the hospital March 3
with 11 broken bones in his skull, a leg fracture and other injuries suffered
while being hit 56 times in a rain of baton blows and kicks.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Hundreds of confidential documents obtained by the Los Angeles Times
indicate that officers who stopped the Altadena motorist played down his
injuries in their official reports.;    But Highway Patrol officers at the
scene told investigators that they were shocked by the ferocity of the
beating.;    Police have now determined that 21 Los Angeles police officers
were at the scene, instead of 15 as initially reported. There were also three
Highway Patrol officers and two school police officers.;    Police officers,
unaware that they had been videotaped by an amateur video buff, said in their
reports that King suffered cuts and bruises "of a minor nature.";    In
contrast, the Highway Patrol officers were so taken aback that they jotted
down Los Angeles officers' names.;    "I didn't see any need to hit him with a
baton," Officer Melanie Singer of the Highway Patrol later told
investigators.;    The conflicting accounts are contained in hundreds of pages
of confidential police reports, witness interviews and other official law
enforcement materials collected by investigators and studied by the county
grand jury, which indicted a sergeant and three officers last week.;    In
"use of force" reports submitted by Sgt. Stacey Koon and officers Laurence M.
Powell and Timothy Wind, King's injuries were listed as "contusions and
abrasions.";    They also marked boxes on the use of force reports saying King
"attacked officers," "continued some resistance" and "increased his
resistance." The videotape shows that King was often in a defenseless
position.;    The grand jury indicted Koon, Powell, Wind and Officer Ted
Briseno on charges of assault with a deadly weapon and beating a suspect under
color of authority. Koon and Powell were also charged with filing a false
police report.;    After the arrest, Koon wrote in his daily report that
reinforcements are needed to ensure a suspect's submission because sometimes
batons and electric stun guns don't work the way they are supposed to.;   
Highway Patrol Officers Tim and Melanie Singer said they saw the first
half-dozen blows inflicted on King. Another Highway Patrol officer, Gabriel
Aid, said he arrived after King was hogtied. Aid said one Los Angeles police
officer asked him, "Did you get any blood on your hands?";    The Singers, a
husband-and-wife team, saw King when he and two passengers were driving on
Interstate 210 at what Melanie Singer estimated were speeds of up to 100 mph.;
   She said King refused to stop, even after her husband advised him over
their car bullhorn: "Pull over to the right. We won't hurt you.";    Los
Angeles police joined the pursuit. Melanie Singer said that, when King got out
of the car, he appeared jovial, dancing and "heavily intoxicated." One
passenger in King's car said they had been drinking malt liquor.;    As
Melanie Singer approached King, she said Koon told her, "No, no. Get back.
We'll handle." She said Koon shot King twice with a Taser stun gun, and King
stumbled to the ground.;    "Officer Powell ran up and struck the suspect on
the right side of his head with his baton," she told investigators. "The
suspect clasped his hands to his face and screamed with pain. He was bleeding.
Powell then struck him five to six more times in rapid succession in the head
and neck area.";    She described the blows as "causing his face to split.";  
 At that point, she said, another Los Angeles police officer grabbed Powell's
arm to stop him, and Koon yelled at Powell, "Stop! Stop! That's enough!";   
"Mr. King appeared to be less resistive," she recalled. "I considered him
disabled.";    None of the Los Angeles officers gave King instructions, she
said.  </TEXT>
