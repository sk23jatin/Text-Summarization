<LEADPARA>  The world reacted with sickened shock and outrage to the brutal beating of a
Southern California man by police officers, played out in painful clarity on
the screens of tens of millions of television sets this week from an amateur
photographer's videotape.;    Some in the black community here reacted with
more of a shrug.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "You talk to people in the black community here, and they say, 'This is not
news,' " said Joe Hicks, an American Civil Liberties Union spokesman who grew
up in the community. "They say, 'Why are all the white people so surprised? A
guy got his butt beat by the cops. It happens all the time.' ";    Behind the
shrug, though, emotions run deep. "There's nothing you can imagine the guy had
done that would justify that kind of response," Hicks said.;    Rodney Glen
King, the victim of the beating, on Wednesday was released from Los Angeles
County Jail after prosecutors said police had failed to prove their charges
that he resisted arrest after a high-speed chase. The 10 officers involved in
the beating have been taken off patrol.;    King told reporters that there had
been no chase, that he had done nothing to provoke the attack and that he was
"scared for my life" during the beating.;    "I'm lucky they didn't kill me,"
King said from a wheelchair, displaying a broken ankle, damaged eye and
bruises.;    He said that police "continued to pound on me and beat on me all
over my body . . . all over my body. My ankles. They beat where it hurt. They
beat my whole body where it hurt.";    Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates,
long controversial for racial statements he has made, called the brutality
depicted on the tape "an aberration.";    The department issued no statements
Wednesday. Agencies including the FBI, the LAPD, Los Angeles District
Attorney's Office and the California Highway Patrol are investigating the
beating.;    Police wanted prosecutors to charge King with battery on an
officer and resisting arrest, said King's lawyer, Robert Rentzer. But the
district attorney's office refused.;    "We have sent the case back to police
for further investigation," said Deputy District Attorney Don Eastman. "There
are a lot of things we want to look at and a lot of witnesses who were not
interviewed.";    The district attorney's office said officers failed to
interview available witnesses, including two of King's passengers.;    The
pursuit of King's white 1988 Hyundai was initiated by CHP officers, who
estimated that King's car was hitting speeds as high as 115 mph on a freeway.
The CHP officers said that they called for assistance and had pulled King over
in the Terrace San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles when several Los
Angeles police officers "jumped into the mess," said a law enforcement source
familiar with the report CHP officers filed with their supervisors. When the
sedan finally stopped off the freeway, King was ordered out of the car.;   
The source said that a police sergeant told the CHP that his officers would
handle things. Witnesses said that King was already lying on the ground when a
police officer shot him with a stun gun, delivering an electrical shock.
Officers then clubbed him wildly. There was a brief lull and King lay silent
until one officer stomped on his head.;    One of the CHP officers at the
scene exhorted the police officers to stop the beating, but was told, in
effect, to "stay out of it," according to the source.;    King, lifting his
hospital garb to show other marks, a large bruise on his chest, said police
"shocked me . . . they paused for a minute and then they struck me across the
face real hard with a billy club.";    The stunning videotape was recorded by
George Holliday, a plumber who was awakened about 12:30 a.m. Sunday by the
sound of police helicopters overhead. Holliday went to the terrace of his
second-story apartment and, seeing police in the street below, decided to get
some practice with his new videotape recorder.;    Witnesses said three or
four officers beat King in the two-minute tape, while as many as seven others
stood by to watch.;    "Please stop! Please stop!" King pleaded as he was
struck at least 40 times with police batons, said witness Dorothy Gibson.;   
King is black. The races of the police officers involved have not been
revealed. King said he didn't hear any racial comments from the officers.;   
"They beat me so bad I didn't pay attention to what they were saying," said
King, who had been released from jail in December after serving 2 1/2 years on
a second-degree robbery conviction.;    "When I saw it on TV, I thought, 'Is
this something happening in South Africa or Kuwait?' " said Keith Huling, 35,
who lives in the same apartment complex as Holliday. "Then I looked a little
closer, and said, 'Hey, that's the park across the street.' ";    Police have
said King resisted arrest. Witnesses have said he did not.;    Huling said he
knows of other police beatings that he believes are racially motivated. A
prevailing sense in his neighborhood this week, he said, is that "if I come
home from work and make a turn on a red light, I'm going to get my butt
kicked.";    The perception that non-Anglos are the targets of police
brutality has been chronic here.;    "Whether that's a perception or a reality
is almost beside the point, because the perception is the reality," said Zev
Yaroslavsky, a councilman who has requested public hearings on brutality
throughout the city. "I am troubled by the fact that when I learned the person
beaten was black, I wasn't surprised. . . . It is rare that there's an Anglo
that gets the crap beat out of him with a billy club.";    Yaroslavsky pointed
to recent incidents of harassment of black people. Just last December,
businessman and former Laker Jamaal Wilkes was handcuffed during a routine
traffic stop. The police department's subsequent apology to him came on the
heels of a federal jury award of $540,000 to former major league baseball
player Joe Morgan, who said Los Angeles police in 1988 had grabbed him by the
neck, thrown him to the ground and cuffed him at Los Angeles International
Airport when they thought he was a drug courier.  </TEXT>
