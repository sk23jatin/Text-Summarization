<LEADPARA>  As Rodney G. King was beaten by Los Angeles police officers on March 3, other
officers seized one of King's passengers, Bryant Allen, who says he was
manhandled and taunted in a racially motivated attempt to provoke him.;    In
an interview, Allen said he feared for his life as he was made to crawl along
the ground, hearing at the same time his friend's screams and the sounds of
police batons from the far side of the car.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "He was screaming, 'Stop!' " said Allen, who said he heard but did not see
his friend being beaten. "Then he kind of quit, and all you could hear was
like bones being broken, a crunching, like a whip sound.";    In the first
complete account of the incident from one who was there, Allen, 25, said he
believed the beating of King and the blows directed at him and a second
passenger, Freddie Helms, were racially motivated.;    All three men in the
car were black. The police officers were white. As many as 21 Los Angeles
police officers were present; a sergeant and three officers have been indicted
on assault charges.;    Allen's lawyer, John C. Burton, said he would file a
federal civil rights suit. King's lawyer said Tuesday he also would file a
suit. None of the three men in the car has been charged.;    Allen tapped his
foot slowly as he sat with his lawyer Tuesday night, watching for the first
time the full seven-minute videotape, which includes the two-minute beating
that has been shown repeatedly on national television.;    The videotape has
led to calls for the resignation of Police Chief Daryl F. Gates and prompted
inquiries into the extent of police brutality nationwide.;    Speaking
quietly, Allen described King's erratic behavior behind the wheel on a night
when the three men had been drinking beer and said tension was heightened when
King had trouble with his seat belt as he was complying with police orders to
leave his car.;    Female officer intervened;  He said that at one point a
female officer intervened when he himself was threatened with violence. "She's
the one who had her hand out saying I didn't do anything wrong," Allen
recalled. She was saying, 'He's the one that had his hands up.' ";   
Nevertheless, he said, he was kicked and manhandled and threatened by officers
who said: "You want to be like your home boy? You want to be like your home
boy?";    Allen said he believed that remarks like "home boy," along with his
physical treatment, were part of an attempt to provoke him.;    Asked why else
he thought the incident was racial, he added, "Three blacks in a car, all
white policemen, the way they look at us.";    Since the incident, he said, he
had spoken twice with King, who suffered multiple fractures and what his
lawyer said may be permanent brain damage. King initially declined to
characterize the incident as racial.;    King can't seem to remember;  He and
King, who is also 25, have known each other at least since they were 13, Allen
said.;    On his recent visits, he said, King was having difficulty
remembering the night of the beating in a coherent way. "It sounded like he
was talking in riddles, all mixed up," Allen said.;    As Allen recalls it,
the late-night incident began with the three men speeding down the Foothill
Freeway in northern Los Angeles at what might have been as fast as 80 mph.
Burton said the men had each drunk a 40-ounce bottle of Olde English 800 malt
liquor.;    Burton said, "Drugs had absolutely nothing to do with this
incident." Medical tests also showed that King was free of drugs.;    After
visiting at Allen's house, the young man said, King told his friends he was
taking them to a park where he had gone in the past with his father.;    When
he saw the flashing lights of a California Highway Patrol car behind them,
Allen said: "I told him, 'Rodney, pull over, stop.' He just kept on going,
kept on driving.";    He said King continued driving on the freeway for about
five minutes, with the patrol car behind them, during which time he continued
to urge him to pull over.;    'Rodney, stop';  "We stopped at a red light and
took off again. We came to another red light. I told him, 'Rodney, stop,' and
he finally went to pull over and he stopped.";    Their small white Hyundai
was surrounded by police cars and illuminated by the glare of headlights.;   
"The police ordered us, 'Driver, put your hands out the window,' " Allen
continued. "Rodney had the seat belt, and it kind of yanked him back. The
police were getting nervous, too. They told him to lie flat down, and he lay
flat down.";    Allen said he and Helms left the car on the opposite side,
beside a large, dark park, and also lay down.;    "The police put the
handcuffs on me, and that's when I heard Rodney screaming," Allen went on.;   
After the screaming stopped, he said, he continued to hear the whipping sound
of the nightsticks through the clatter of a hovering helicopter. Police
officers in Los Angeles use standard-issue PR-24 aluminum nightsticks that are
24 inches long and weigh 27 ounces.;    "They made me crawl a certain way, to
scoot. I was flat down. I was definitely frightened. I thought I was going to
get shot or something.";    By that time, he said, King had stopped screaming.
"I just closed my eyes," Allen said. "Whatever was happening to him, I didn't
want to see."  </TEXT>
