<TEXT>     Police wanted prosecutors to charge King with battery on an officer and
resisting arrest, said King's lawyer, Robert Rentzer. But the district
attorney's office refused.;    "We have sent the case back to police for
further investigation," said Deputy District Attorney Don Eastman. "There are
a lot of things we want to look at and a lot of witnesses who were not
interviewed.";    The district attorney's office said officers failed to
interview available witnesses, including two of King's passengers. The 10
officers involved in the beating have been taken off patrol.;    King told
reporters that there had been no high-speed car chase as they insisted, that
he had done nothing to provoke the attack and that he was "scared for my life"
during the beating.;    "I'm lucky they didn't kill me," he said.;   
Witnesses back King's version of what happened early Sunday morning in a Los
Angeles suburb, and a CHP officer at the scene said he exhorted the police
officers to stop the beating, but was told, in effect, to "stay out of it,"
according to a source.;    The pursuit of King's white 1988 Hyundai was begun
by CHP officers, who estimated that King's car was hitting speeds as high as
115 mph on a freeway. The CHP officers said that they called for assistance
and had pulled King over in the Terrace San Fernando Valley area of Los
Angeles.;    At that point, several Los Angeles police officers "jumped into
the mess," said a law enforcement source familiar with the report CHP officers
filed with their supervisors. When the car finally stopped off the freeway,
King was ordered out of the car.;    The source said that a police sergeant
told the CHP that his officers would handle things. Witnesses said that King
was already lying on the ground when a police officer shot him with a stun
gun, delivering an electrical shock. Officers then clubbed him wildly. There
was a brief lull and King lay silent until one officer stomped on his head.;  
 King said that police "continued to pound on me and beat on me all over my
body . . . all over my body. My ankles. They beat where it hurt. They beat my
whole body where it hurt.";    King, lifting his hospital garb to show a large
bruise on his chest, said police "shocked me . . . they paused for a minute
and then they struck me across the face real hard with a billy club.";   
Witnesses said three or four officers beat King in the two-minute tape, while
as many as seven others stood by to watch.;    "Please stop! Please stop!"
King pleaded as he was struck at least 40 times with police batons, said
witness Dorothy Gibson.;    King is black. The races of the police officers
involved have not been revealed. King said he didn't hear any racial comments
from the officers.;    "They beat me so bad I didn't pay attention to what
they were saying," said King, who had been released from jail in December
after serving 2 1/2 years on a second-degree robbery conviction.;    "When I
saw it on TV, I thought, 'Is this something happening in South Africa or
Kuwait?' " said Keith Huling, 35, who lives in the same apartment complex as
Holliday. "Then I looked a little closer, and said, 'Hey, that's the park
across the street.' ";    Witnesses said King did not resist arrest.;    The
stunning videotape was recorded by George Holliday, a plumber who was awakened
about 12:30 a.m. Sunday by the sound of police helicopters overhead. Holliday
went to the terrace of his second-story apartment and, seeing police in the
street below, decided to get some practice with his new videotape recorder.;  
 The world reacted with sickened shock and outrage to the brutal, but some
some in the black community here reacted with more of a shrug.;    "You talk
to people in the black community here, and they say, 'This is not news,' "
said Joe Hicks, an American Civil Liberties Union spokesman who grew up in the
community. "They say, 'Why are all the white people so surprised? A guy got
his butt beat by the cops. It happens all the time.' ";    Behind the shrug,
though, emotions run deep. "There's nothing you can imagine the guy had done
that would justify that kind of response," Hicks said.;    Los Angeles Police
Chief Daryl Gates, long controversial for racial statements he has made,
called the brutality depicted on the tape "an aberration.";    The department
issued no statements Wednesday. Agencies including the FBI, the LAPD, Los
Angeles District Attorney's Office and the California Highway Patrol are
investigating the beating.;    Huling said he knows of other police beatings
that he believes are racially motivated. A prevailing sense in his
neighborhood this week, he said, is that "if I come home from work and make a
turn on a red light, I'm going to get my butt kicked.";    The perception that
non-Anglos are the targets of police brutality has been chronic here.;   
"Whether that's a perception or a reality is almost beside the point, because
the perception is the reality," said Zev Yaroslavsky, a councilman who has
requested public hearings on brutality throughout the city. "I am troubled by
the fact that when I learned the person beaten was black, I wasn't surprised.
. . . It is rare that there's an Anglo that gets the crap beat out of him with
a billy club.";    Yaroslavsky pointed to recent incidents of harassment of
black people. Just last December, businessman and former Laker Jamaal Wilkes
was handcuffed during a routine traffic stop. The police department's
subsequent apology to him came on the heels of a federal jury award of
$540,000 to former major league baseball player Joe Morgan, who said Los
Angeles police in 1988 had grabbed him by the neck, thrown him to the ground
and cuffed him at Los Angeles International Airport when they thought he was a
drug courier.;    Last year, 55 residents of one of the city's streets
accepted a $3 million settlement for damages from a 1988 police drug raid in
which officers allegedly wrecked apartments and beat several people.;    "I
don't think the body politic in Los Angeles has been willing to address it,"
Yaroslavsky said. "But what the public has seen in black and white, no pun
intended, leaves nothing to the imagination, leaves nothing to interpretation,
(and) probably is the one event that may sensitize" the politicians.  </TEXT>
