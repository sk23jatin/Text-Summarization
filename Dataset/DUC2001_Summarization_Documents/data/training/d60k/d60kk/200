On June 6, a Los Angeles man, Rodney King, was stopped by California
Highway Patrol officers after a high speed chase.  Los Angeles police
took over when he left the highway. Witnesses said that after he left
the car, police shot him with a stun gun and then kicked him and beat
him repeatedly with sticks as he lay helpless.

Bystanders included local residents and several policemen. A nearby
resident videotaped the scene.  The tape was passed to local media,
then national news, stirring public outrage. Police, FBI and the
District Attorney are investigating.

Mr. King and his two passengers, all black, said they had consumed
some beer, but no drugs.  Tests confirmed this.  One passenger told of
being racially taunted and forced to crawl on the ground as King was
beaten.

The ACLU says such incidents are common.  Black Los Angeles residents
reportedly agree.

Mr. King required hospital treatment for facial and leg fractures,
suffers from numbness of the face and headaches and is described as
depressed and frightened.  He was not charged, but a number of
policemen have been suspended and several indicted for assault. </SUM>
