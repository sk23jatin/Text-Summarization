   More than 30 years ago, Life magazine
took a look at the burgeoning little desert town of Las Vegas and
wondered if it wasn't overbuilt.
   The year was 1955 and five new resort hotels had just opened,
prompting the magazine to question where they would get people to
fill them.
   ``Has Las Vegas pushed its luck too far?'' Life asked.
   History has proven doubters to be wrong. Las Vegas has grown
from a dusty town of a few resorts into a booming metropolis of
more than 600,000 people, with nearly 60,000 hotel and motel rooms
to accomodate tourists.
   Now, as Las Vegas undergoes one of the most ambitious of its
periodic building booms, there are few who believe that
overbuilding is a problem. Tourism is growing and the gaming and
resort industries are attempting to capitalize on the trend.
   ``There is still a tremendous amount of demand out there that
hasn't been satisified,'' said Rossi Ralenkotter, director of
marketing for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.
``We're in a very strong growth pattern and all indications are
that it will continue.''
   Nearly 20,000 new hotel rooms either are under construction or
awaiting groundbreaking, as resorts compete to add rooms they hope
will bring in even more tourists and gamblers in the near future.
   Part of that optimism is based on figures showing hotels
averaged 90.2 percent occupancy during 1987. Such extremely high
rates meant potential guests often were turned away by a lack of
rooms: on weekends, it is nearly impossible to get a room and on
three-day holiday weekends it's even worse.
   Visitor volume nearly has doubled in the last 12 years, with an
estimated 17 million tourists each expected to spend an average of
2-3 days in Las Vegas during 1988.
   Gaming revenues kept pace, growing 14 percent in 1987 to a
record $2.74 billion in southern Nevada.
   ``We're penetrating markets we've never penetrated before,''
said Dave Verbon, publicity director at the Riviera Hotel. ``There
are vast numbers of people out there we never tried to reach before
and now we're going after them and getting them.''
   Already boasting the world's two largest resort hotels, Las
Vegas soon will have five hotel-casinos with more than 3,000 rooms
apiece. Two resorts _ the Riviera and the Flamingo Hilton _ are
about to begin work on expansions that will bring them to more than
4,000 rooms apiece.
   The Riviera opened a new 1,000-room highrise March 1 and plans
to begin construction of a 1,700-room tower in the fall.
   ``You have to build towers to have a very high volume of
business to drive a large casino with a large number of slot
machines and blackjack tables,'' said Verbon. ``We think there are
enough potential customers to support these huge hotels.''
   The centerpiece of the new construction is the Golden Nugget, a
massive resort rising from a desert parcel adjacent to Caesars
Palace. When finished sometime late next year, the $550 million
resort will have 3,200 guest rooms set in a watery tropical setting
that hotel officials claim will be like nothing Las Vegas has ever
seen.
   ``It's really on a completely different plane in terms of what
we presently have,'' said Nugget President Bobby Baldwin. ``It's
very difficult to compare the new Nugget to anything.''
   Baldwin says he has few worries that the Nugget will be able to
fill its rooms with gamblers and tourists. The company's downtown
resort regularly sells out its rooms.
   ``We're very bullish,'' he said. ``Tour and travel continues to
grow and the individual traveler market continues to expand,
particularly from Southern California. International business has
also expanded in the last few months and we hope to see that
continue.''
   The tourism economy has been helped by the growth in three-day
weekends and a national trend toward mini-vacations of 2-3 days.
Las Vegas has also been very successful in landing conventions,
which attracted 1.6 million people to the city in 1987.
   Part of the Las Vegas lure also comes from room rates that
average $45 a night, far below the $100 or more charged by
non-gaming hotels in other cities.
   ``It's the bargain aspect, the ability to have a very enjoyable
convention or vacation visit at far less expense than any other
destination,'' said Ralenkotter.
   The city's hotels in the past four to five years have begun
exploiting the vast middle-class and tourism markets they once
eschewed in favor of attracting a handful of high-rolling gamblers.
   The expanded customer base, hotel operators believe, gives them
protection against a recession or sudden rise in fuel prices that
could have a negative impact on tourism levels.
   In the early 1980s, a national recession combined with high fuel
prices and the legalization of gambling in Atlantic City stopped
the Las Vegas growth rate in its tracks.
   ``In good times everybody does pretty well and the better
operators do even better,'' said Baldwin. ``In bad times good
operators don't do quite as well but they still do well. The best
operators do great in both times.''
