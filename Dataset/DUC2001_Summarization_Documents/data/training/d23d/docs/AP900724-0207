   In a state with few people, the city with the
most wins the power game. In Nevada, that makes Las Vegas the
undisputed champ.
   Las Vegas, which welcomes as many as 6,000 new residents a
month, is the reason Nevada is the nation's fastest-growing state.
The city's population is expected to reach 1 million by 1995, four
times what it was in 1980.
   An estimated 800,000 people live there now, out of 1.3 million
in the state as a whole. The three rural counties fighting Clark
County's water plan have a combined population of less than 35,000.
   That means Clark County controls the Nevada Legislature: 36 of
63 state lawmakers are from the Las Vegas area, and the contingent
is sure to grow with next year's reapportionment. So what Clark
County wants, Clark County has the numbers to get.
   ``If there's something in state water law we can hang our hat on
to deter this plan, the power is in Las Vegas and Clark County and
they'll just go ahead and change the law,'' said Steve Bradhurst, a
consultant to the rural counties.
   Las Vegas also is the state's financial anchor. Last year, Clark
County casinos accounted for 70 percent of the state's $4.6 billion
in gaming revenues. Clark County needs to keep growing for the
state's economic health, officials say.
   ``There is one large metropolitan area from which the bulk of
all revenues in this state come, and that's Clark County,'' said
Pat Mulroy, manager of the Las Vegas Valley Water District. ``If .
.. it goes downhill, the whole state goes downhill.''
