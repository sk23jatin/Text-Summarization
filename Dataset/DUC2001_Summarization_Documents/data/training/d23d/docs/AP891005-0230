   Plans announced by billionaire Kirk Kerkorian
to build a 5,000-room resort here would allow Las Vegas to claim
the eight largest hotels in the world by 1992, according to
industry statistics.
   Of course, Las Vegas' domination of the list dpends on other
cities not building big hotels between now and 1992.
   The Las Vegas Hilton currently claims the title with 3,174 rooms
but will be surpassed next March when an expansion is completed at
the Flamingo Hilton, giving that Strip resort 3,530 rooms. The
Flamingo will hold the title only a few months, until the Excalibur
opens next summer with 4,032 rooms.
   Steve Wynn's Mirage Hotel opens next month with 3,054 rooms.
   Circus Circus, the parent corporation for Excalibur, currently
has 2,800 rooms in Las Vegas, as does Bally's Hotel on the Strip.
   The Riviera Hotel currently has 2,200 rooms but a planned
expansion will give the resort 3,800 rooms by June of 1992.
   Kerkorian built the International Hotel, now the Las Vegas
Hilton, and the MGM Grand, now Bally's. He also owned the Flamingo
at one time.
   The Hilton Hawaiian Village in Honolulu currently has 2,525
rooms, making it the largest hotel, in number of rooms, outside of
Las Vegas, according to figures in the Hotel and Motel Index. The
number of rooms at the Hawaiian property is not expected to change
in the near future because the hotel recently completed an
expansion, according to Las Vegas Hilton spokesman Bruce Banke.
   Outside the United States, the New Otani Hotel in Tokyo leads in
number of rooms with 2,056.
