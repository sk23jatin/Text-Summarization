   Sin City is about to meet its Maker.
   The first contingents of up to 18,000 Southern Baptists began
arriving this weekend for an ``evangelistic blitz'' in the nation's
gambling capital. They hope to leave behind 12 new churches and tens
of thousands of religious tracts by the end of their annual
convention.
   ``I embrace the old philosophy, if someone gives you a lemon, you
make lemonade,'' said John B. Wright, a convention organizer.
   Las Vegas, which has welcomed conventions of strippers and
swingers in recent years, is ready for the Southern Baptists.
   ``We want all the conventions we can get and we don't give a damn
who they are,'' said John Reible, a spokesman for the Las Vegas
Chamber of Commerce.
   The site represents a marriage of convenience for Southern
Baptists and the city built on the vices they condemn.
   The 14.8 million-member Southern Baptist Convention has more than
doubled its membership in a quarter century and surpassed the United
Methodist Church as the nation's largest Protestant denomination.
Las Vegas, a desert town of 5,600 little more than five decades ago,
is growing at the rate of 3,000 people a month and there are now
about 700,000 people in the region.
   Las Vegas is one of only 15 U.S. cities that can provide the
hotel rooms and exhibit space for a Southern Baptist convention,
said Alvin C. Shackleford, a convention spokesman.
   ``It just seemed sooner or later we would accept the invitation
of the people of Las Vegas to come,'' he said. There are about
22,000 Southern Baptists in 71 churches in Nevada.
   Six years after the denomination voted to meet in Las Vegas, the
decision still evokes controversy, and many Southern Baptists have
decided to stay home.
   While conventions in recent years have drawn as many as 45,000
people, estimates for the convention running Tuesday through
Thursday range from 13,000 to 18,000.
   Reasons include the reluctance of Southern Baptists to expose
their children to the gambling scene, the city's remoteness from the
denomination's strongholds in the Southeast and an apparent lack of
burning issues as the struggle between the denomination's moderates
and conservatives stretches into its 11th year.
   Southern Baptists leaders say Las Vegas offers an opportunity to
put aside internal battles and emphasize evangelism.
   ``The choice of Las Vegas was deliberate in that the Southern
Baptist Convention hopes it can do sort of an evangelistic blitz in
Las Vegas,'' said Stan Hastey, executive director of the Southern
Baptist Alliance, a moderate group.
   A series of revivals in city churches led up to a campaign
Saturday in which about 2,000 Southern Baptists were expected knock
on doors around Las Vegas.
   To keep the focus on evangelism when the meetings begin,
convention President Jerry Vines said he is seeking postponement of
a controversial proposal by conservatives to create a Religious
Liberty Commission. The commission would lobby Congress on issues
such as organized prayer in public schools and tax credits for
tuition paid to parochial schools.
   Church leaders said the internal struggle has taken a toll on the
evangelistic efforts of the denomination, where membership has
increased barely more than half a percent in each of the last two
years.
   ``The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing,'' said
Jay Strack, president of the Conference of Southern Baptist
Evangelists.
   On Wednesday, the conference plans to lead thousands of Southern
Baptists down the gambling Strip to distribute 10,000 New Testaments
and 20,000 gospel tracts, Strack said.
   Las Vegas officials and some church leaders say the city
variously known over the years as Sin City, Sin City West and Lost
Wages is undeserving of special attention.
   ``Las Vegas is probably no more notorious in its pagan qualities
than any other city,'' Hastey said.
   Robert Powers, a spokesman for the Las Vegas Convention and
Visitors Authority, said life in the residential areas outside the
Strip is little different from anywhere else.
   In addition to bringing in up to $15 million in revenue, the
Southern Baptist convention should help the city's image, Powers
said.
   ``I think it's good for the city that a group like this is
meeting here,'' he said.
