<LEADPARA>  WHILE Lou Rawls performs at the Golden Nugget and exotic showgirls romp at the
Stardust, a packed showroom at the Desert Inn Hotel and Casino is anxiously
awaiting the arrival of Mr. Cucumber from Taiwan.;    "Ladies and gentlemen!"
the master of ceremonies shouts in Chinese as the band cranks up. "That
superstar king of Taiwan comedy, Hu Gua!"  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The crowd cheers. The tuxedo-clad Chinese performer, whose stage name means
"cucumber" in Chinese, storms onto center stage through a flood of pulsating
lights and billowing stage smoke.;    Hu Gua, the "Johnny Carson of Taiwan,"
launches into a snappy Chinese tune.;    "Oh, he's good," one woman swoons.
"He's the king.";    It is a sign of the changing times on the Las Vegas
Strip. Where Liberace, Wayne Newton and Sammy Davis Jr. once ruled, the
marquees now blare with names such as Hu Gua, Ma Shih-li and Yang Lieh.;   
Las Vegas -- that paradigm of American excess and decadence -- has discovered
Asia.;    Stung by seesawing oil prices, competition from Atlantic City, N.J.,
and a moribund U.S. economy, Las Vegas has turned its attention toward Japan,
Hong Kong, Taiwan and other booming Asian countries in search of gamblers.;   
Instead of Middle Eastern potentates or Texas oil barons, it is the Asian
gambler who has become not only the most sought after high-roller of the '90s,
but also, with the growth of the Asian community on the West Coast, the
low-roller as well.;    "They gamble every day, they wager against each other,
they play hard," said Terry Lanni, president of Caesars World Inc., which owns
Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.;    As the world economy shifts toward the Far
East, the ripples are being felt in this opulent outpost in the desert.;   
Casinos are courting the Asian gambler with everything from $6 overnight bus
tours from Los Angeles' Chinatown to all-expense-paid junkets out of
Indonesia, Taiwan and South Korea.;    The largest casinos, such as Caesars
Palace and the Mirage, have opened year-round marketing offices in the Far
East, and most have introduced Asian games into their repertoire, such as pai
gow and sic bo.;    "The business from Asia has just exploded incredibly,"
said Desert Inn President Kevin J. Malley. "They are the No. 1 gamblers in the
world right now.";    Old-timers around Glitter Gulch say the importance of
the Asian gambler to Las Vegas has been mounting for the past two decades.;   
Far Eastern gamblers have enjoyed a longstanding reputation as loyal and
persistent players, which they attribute to the entrepreneurial spirit that
created the Asian economic boom.;    But it was only in the 1980s, as the
Japanese gross national product nearly tripled to $3.1 trillion and the Taiwan
stock market index grew eightfold in four years, that the pursuit of the Far
Eastern gambler reached fever pitch.;    In the last five years, casinos have
begun scurrying to outdo each other with ever more opulent Asian parties,
Asian gaming areas and Asian restaurants.;    Las Vegas also exerts a powerful
allure for Asian visitors from the gray industrial centers of the Far East,
who are fascinated by not only the gambling (illegal in most of Asia) but also
the excessive vision of opulence that pervades the city.;    "Everyone wants
to come to America to become wealthy," said Ling Chuang, a 24-year-old
Alhambra student who was on her first visit to Las Vegas. "This is America. It
is so prosperous, like an illusion.";    The biggest casino market is still
the domestic one, but Asian gamblers exert a power that far exceeds their
numbers.;    Malley estimated that 90 of the casino's top 100 gamblers are
Asians and that about 45 percent of the casino's revenue comes from the
Pacific Rim.;    "It's not just limited to the Desert Inn," Malley said. "The
same is true of Caesars, the Mirage or whatever.";    The increasing flow of
Asian tourists has transformed not just the casinos, but Las Vegas as well.;  
 The Asian population in town has increased with the demand for bilingual
casino workers. Sightseeing companies, hotels, restaurants and even escort
services regularly advertise in Asian languages now.;    The renowned Chicken
Ranch brothel near Las Vegas recently had its sex menu printed in Japanese,
leading to such translational challenges as "Fantasy Session" and "Y'all come
back now -- y'hear.";    But there have been numerous missteps, as well, as
businesses have leaped into the race to tap into the Pacific Rim.;    The
Mirage had designed a private gambling area with shelves of books along the
walls, only to discover later that the Chinese word for "library" is
pronounced the same as "room of losses." The books were quickly removed.  </TEXT>
