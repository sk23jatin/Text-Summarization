   Separate strong earthquakes rocked northern Japan
and the main Philippine island of Luzon today, swaying buildings
and trees but apparently not causing any serious injuries or
damage, officials said.
   The Japanese quake registered a preliminary 5.2 on the Richter
scale and was the second strong temblor to hit the northern island
of Hokkaido in less than three days, Central Meteorological Agency
officials said.
   They said it struck at 7:44 a.m. (6:44 p.m. Sunday) and was
centered in the Hidaka mountain range, 45 miles away from
Saturday's earthquake, which measured a preliminary 6.4 on the
scale. Local police said there were no immediate reports of damage
or casualties.
   The pre-dawn Philippine earthquake struck at 3:45 a.m. (3:55
p.m. Sunday) and registered a preliminary 5.4 Richter reading, the
Royal Observatory of Hong Kong said. The Philippine Institute of
Volcanology and Seismology said it was centered 110 miles northwest
of Manila under the Luzon Sea.
   Earthquakes measuring 5 on the open-ended Richter scale are
classified as strong and capable of causing considerable damage in
populated areas. However, both quakes were located deep below the
earth's surface and therefore caused little damage, officials said.
   Both earthquakes also occurred in quake-prone areas where edges
of the earth's crustal plates are thought to rub together, a
Central Meteorological Agency official said.
   ``It's been some time since we had earthquake activity in that
area of Hokkaido, so it's not surprising to have some now caused by
a build-up of pressure between the plates,'' he said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The official said there was no way of knowing whether the
Japanese quake was related to the one in the Philippines, 2,250
miles away.
   The Philippine islands are thought to be located on the edge of
a separate, smaller crustal plate which extends up to southern
Japan.
   Institute spokesman Ulpiano Trillanes said the Philippine
earthquake affected a wide area of Luzon island, including Manila,
but apparently caused no serious damage or injuries.
   In the past 35 years there have been two major earthquakes in
Hokkaido. In 1968, the Tokachi-Oki earthquake measuring a 7.9 on
the Richter scale killed 52 people.
   The Richter scale measures the total magnitude of an earthquake.
Every increase of one digit in the scale represents a tenfold
increase in magnitude, thus a reading of 4.5 would be 10 times
stronger than one of 5.5.
