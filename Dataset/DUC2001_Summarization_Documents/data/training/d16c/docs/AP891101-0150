   A major earthquake registering 7.1 on the Richter
scale struck off northeastern Honshu Island early today, officials
said. Three coastal villages were ordered evacuated for fear of
tidal waves, officials said.
   There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage from the
quake, which struck at 3:26 a.m. Thursday (1:26 p.m. Wednesday
EST). It was centered about 60 miles off the coast and at a depth
of 20 miles, the Central Meteorological Agency in Tokyo said.
   After the quake, officials closed the major expressway through
the affected region for inspection and overnight trains were
stopped to check the condition of the rails.
   The agency warned of a tsunami, or seismic tidal wave, hitting
coastal towns on northeast Honshu and the northernmost main island
of Hokkaido. The agency said sea levels two hours after the quake
had risen nearly three feet in the region.
   Officials ordered the evacuation of the villages of Taro,
Sanriku and Ozutsu, about 300 miles northeast of Tokyo on Honshu's
eastern coast.
   The agency said the quake had a magnitude of 7.1 on the Richter
scale, the same as the Oct. 17 earthquake that devastated the San
Francisco Bay area. In Washington, the U.S. Geological Survey said
the quake measured 7.3 on the Richter scale.
   U.S. Geological Survey scientists said they recorded an
aftershock measuring 5.8 about 10 minutes after the main quake.
   The main earthquake was the strongest in that region in more
than 58 years, since a magnitude 7.7 earthquake March 9, 1931, said
Don Finley, a spokesman for the U.S. agency.
   The earthquake occurred in the same general area as a series of
earlier tremors during the past several weeks. The strongest of the
earlier quakes was a magnitude 6.5 on Sunday.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.
   Japan is situated on a major fault line that produces frequent
earthquakes, few of which cause serious damage.
