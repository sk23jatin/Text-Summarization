<TEXT>
<P>
Far beneath this modern metropolis, the powerful forces of nature are locked in 
a slow but deadly battle that will some day bring this great city to its knees. 
</P>
<P>
Already overcrowded and growing at a staggering rate, Tokyo sits on a deep 
sedimentary basin that is like a bowl of jello cradled by one of the most 
treacherous geological formations on the planet. Bluntly put, there are few 
places on Earth that are geologically less suited as a site for a great city 
than here on the shores of Tokyo Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the giant slabs of the Earth's crust grind together here in what 
scientists call a "triple junction." Two of the plates sink beneath the islands 
of Japan and then collide again as they plunge deep into the Earth directly 
below Tokyo, setting the stage for catastrophic earthquakes that have destroyed 
the city in the past and could well do so again in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Most other earthquake-prone regions, including California, only have to worry 
about two colliding plates. 
</P>
<P>
The threat will get worse in the years ahead because more and more land is 
being reclaimed from Tokyo Bay to serve the needs of millions more who are 
flocking to a city already strangling on its own prosperity. Scientists are 
concerned that land reclaimed from the bay will be particularly hazardous 
because such soils amplify shock waves from earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
Painfully aware of its problems, Japan is moving full speed ahead in earthquake 
engineering research, and the country is trying to develop the world's best 
earthquake warning system before the next great quake hits. But some experts 
believe Tokyo is already past due for a catastrophic quake, and scientists 
around the world are watching to see if Japan can win a race against time. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of a giant quake here could be felt around the world. Tokyo is a key 
player in global economics, and some officials fear that a catastrophic quake 
here could have a devastating effect elsewhere. Frank Press, president of the 
U.S. National Academy of Sciences, has speculated that a great quake here would 
force Japan to reclaim much of its foreign investment, possibly leading to a 
collapse of the world economy. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo was leveled once, in 1923, when a monstrous earthquake destroyed a city 
that had ignored the lessons offered in 1906 from a different city by a distant 
bay. "If we had understood the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the damages from 
the Great Kanto Earthquake which came just 17 years later could have been 
avoided," says Hirokazu Iemura of Kyoto University's Earthquake Engineering 
Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
Iemura, who toured the Bay Area after last October's quake, is afraid history 
may repeat itself. The recent San Francisco temblor, he said, demonstrated what 
scientists call "non-linear" consequences of an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
That means that in some cases the earth may tremble far more than the magnitude 
of the quake would suggest. The Bay Area quake suggested that Tokyo too may be 
much more vulnerable than experts had thought. 
</P>
<P>
For this and other reasons, Tokyo, most experts agree, has much to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
A study last year by Japan's National Land Agency concluded that if a great 
earthquake -- magnitude 8 or greater -- should strike Tokyo in the middle of 
the night it would kill about 80,000 people. If it came at lunch time, as it 
did in 1923, or in the evening when stoves would be lit for cooking and 
heating, fires would sweep through parts of the city and the death toll could 
reach 150,000. Many experts here think even those grim estimates are far too 
low. 
</P>
<P>
When the great quake strikes, as everyone here knows it must, it will hit a 
city that is already so crowded that on a typical day it dwarfs the worst 
traffic jams that Los Angeles has to offer. 
</P>
<P>
Despite widespread planning efforts, there will be few places for people to 
run, and it will be extremely difficult to reach safety even for those who know 
where to go. The danger will not be just from falling objects. It will be 
mainly from fire. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 1923 earthquake, 100,000 people burned to death," Iemura said. That is 
more than twice as many as were killed directly by the 7.9 temblor. And now, 
all these years later, Iemura and many other experts in Japan are afraid that 
history may repeat itself. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very afraid of fire," said Etsuzo Shima, professor emeritus at the 
University of Tokyo and one of Japan's leading earthquake experts. "We have 
many wooden houses and the roads are very narrow, and if there is a big fire in 
the region, many of them will be burned." 
</P>
<P>
Nario Oyagi, a geologist-engineer with Japan's National Research Center for 
Disaster Prevention, thinks Tokyo's congested streets pose a special problem. 
In his worst nightmares, he sees endless streams of cars ablaze on crowded 
streets, forming ribbons of fire extending out to the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
Hampered by ruptured water lines, unable to move on the jammed streets, 
firefighters would be helpless, forced to witness a holocaust of unthinkable 
dimensions. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo's Metropolitan Fire Department has estimated that fully one-third of the 
city could be destroyed by fire in a great quake. Japanese authorities are well 
aware of their peril, and have made dramatic progress in earthquake 
engineering. The modern buildings of Japan are among the best engineered in the 
world, and even many older structures are well built because earthquakes here 
are so much a part of life. 
</P>
<P>
But no amount of planning can reduce the geological hazard that lies beneath 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very complex place," said Yoshimitsu Okada, who is in charge of the 
most ambitious effort in the world to predict an earthquake. Okada directs a 
research team that hopes to predict a major quake about 100 miles south of 
Tokyo in time to evacuate several crowded cities. 
</P>
<P>
Okada knows the quake will come some day because the geological formations 
beneath Japan are constantly active. 
</P>
<P>
The Earth's crust is made up of giant tectonic plates that drift around the 
planet. The plates slide against each other in some regions, like California, 
causing earthquakes. In other areas, an oceanic plate slides beneath a 
continental plate through subduction. The latter is the process that created 
the active volcanoes of the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
The islands of Japan are on the Eurasia Plate, which is sliding up over two 
other plates, the giant Pacific Plate (which also grinds against California on 
its opposite side) and the Philippine Sea Plate. 
</P>
<P>
The Philippine and Pacific plates are being pushed under Japan as the powerful 
forces crunch together, creating volcanoes as they heat the underside of the 
Eurasia Plate. And unfortunately for Tokyo, directly beneath the mega-city, the 
two oceanic plates are colliding as they sink into the Earth's mantle. 
</P>
<P>
Temblors occur as the plates are ripped apart while being forced under the 
Eurasia Plate, so they strike much deeper than the shallow earthquakes in 
California. However, they can be quite large, well above magnitude 8, so they 
pose a great danger to areas on the surface. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the strength of an earthquake here is magnified by the geological 
conditions that underlie nearly the entire city of Tokyo. Like Los Angeles, 
Tokyo and many other cities in Japan are built on sedimentary deposits that 
have washed down from the mountains over millions of years. 
</P>
<P>
Those deposits have formed a huge sedimentary basin beneath what is now the 
city of Tokyo. In some cases, that basin is up to two miles thick. 
</P>
<P>
When an earthquake occurs, the waves of energy flowing from the epicenter are 
magnified by shifting sedimentary deposits, making the ground shaking more 
intense. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo has an additional problem because the bedrock on which the sedimentary 
basin sits is shaped somewhat like a bowl. Shock waves striking the bedrock are 
reflected back up toward the surface, extending the life of the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"The duration of the shaking is very long," said Oyagi, of the National 
Research Center for Disaster Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
Officials here know those conditions could add up to disaster for Tokyo, a 
belief that was reinforced by Kyoto University's Iemura when he returned from 
his tour of the San Francisco Bay Area after the Oct. 17 quake. He has 
concluded that Japan still has much to learn from San Francisco as well as 
Mexico City, which was ravaged by a 7.9 earthquake in 1985 that killed about 
9,500 people and caused $3 billion in damages. 
</P>
<P>
Most experts here had thought that Mexico City was an "exceptional case," 
Iemura said. The sprawling city is built on an ancient lake bed, and scientists 
believe it was particularly vulnerable to ground failure from liquefaction. 
That occurs when a shallow water table causes the loose sediments to assume the 
characteristics of a liquid during a large earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"This (liquefaction) had been thought of as very exceptional," Iemura said. 
</P>
<P>
But the Bay Area quake demonstrated that liquefaction can occur "along the 
coast," as in San Francisco's Marina District, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"Mexico had been thought so exceptional there was no need to think about it," 
Iemura said. "But what about San Francisco? Is that also a special case?" 
</P>
<P>
Although he thinks the question needs more study, Iemura is troubled by the 
fact that much of Tokyo is built on areas similar to San Francisco's Marina 
District. 
</P>
<P>
And like San Francisco, Tokyo is extremely short of land on which to build the 
high rises needed to house the millions who continue to flock to this crowded 
city. 
</P>
<P>
The answer to the land shortage, Japanese authorities have concluded, is to 
reclaim more land from Tokyo Bay -- a prospect that deeply troubles many 
experts. Many of the new structures going up in Tokyo these days are built on 
filled land, and some people here hope someday to fill in the entire bay, 
making room for even more people and more buildings. 
</P>
<P>
If San Francisco was not an "exceptional case," that trend could prove 
disastrous, many experts believe. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo University's Shima believes there is only one answer, and that is to 
reverse the flow of people into Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
One group is proposing that the capital be moved out of Tokyo, hoping that the 
forced move of government workers will result in a lower death toll when the 
quake hits. Local authorities are resisting that suggestion, but Shima insists 
that some people are now taking it seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very afraid because we are now going to build a lot of high-rise 
buildings in the bay area," he said. "That will increase the population, and 
that's not so good." 
</P>
<P>
The earthquake hazards facing Tokyo are not just a local problem because Japan 
has become a major participant -- some say the dominant player -- in 
international economics. A devastating quake here would be felt in board rooms 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Experts believe insurance companies would be able to cover only a small 
percentage of the loss. The Japanese government has put a ceiling of around 
$60,000 on each private residence in a city where a humble abode costs 10 times 
that amount. 
</P>
<P>
And Tokyo is a major nerve center in the fragile network that constitutes the 
global economy.

DANGEROUS INTERSECTION 
</P>
<P>
Japan ranks among the most geologically active regions in the world. 
Earthquakes occur chiefly in areas where giant slabs of the Earth's crust, 
called tectonic plates, either grind past each other or crunch together in a 
process called "subduction" that forces one plate under another. 
</P>
<P>
Japan, however, has to concern itself with four plates. Most of the islands are 
on the giant Eurasia Plate, although the North American Plate reaches up over 
the Arctic and down to the northern tip of the archipelago. The Pacific and the 
Philippine Sea plates are being forced under the Eurasia Plate, and the two 
subducting plates collide directly beneath Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
That dynamic process is why the region is capable of generating catastrophic 
earthquakes, like the temblor that destroyed Tokyo in 1923, as well as about 
1,000 smaller quakes every month.
