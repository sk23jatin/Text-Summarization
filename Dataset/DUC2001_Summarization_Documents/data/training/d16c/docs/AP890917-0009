   A strong earthquake shook the Caspian Sea
region of the Soviet Union and Iran before dawn Sunday, the third
relatively strong earthquake in the area since Tuesday, Iran's
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   There was no word of casualties or damage from the quake centered
in Soviet Azerbaijan 250 miles northwest of Tehran, measuring 5.6 on
the Richter scale, said the agency monitored in Nicosia.
   An observatory in Hong Kong said the quake was centered in the
Caspian Sea about 120 miles northeast of the Azerbaijani capital and
port city of Baku and measured 6.5 on the Richter scale.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, said Tehran and other cities in
northern Iran were jolted by the earthquake registered by the Tehran
University Geophysics Center at 4:24 a.m. (8:54 p.m. EDT Saturday).
   IRNA reported Saturday that an earthquake registering 5.5 on the
Richter scale shook the region Saturday. The U.S. Geological Survey
in Washington said that quake, also with an epicenter east of Baku,
registered 6.6.
   Another tremor registering 5.2 shook the area around Gorgan, 185
miles east of Tehran on Tuesday, IRNA said.
   Iran is shaken by hundreds of earthquakes a year, ranging from
2.4 to 5.5 on the Richter Scale. The last major earthquake,
registering 7.7, was in September 1978. It killed 25,000 people.
   The Richter scale is a measure of energy released by an
earthquake as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one whole
number means a tenfold increase in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 5 on the Richter scale can cause serious damage
and one of 7 can cause widespread heavy damage.
