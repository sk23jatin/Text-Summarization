   A major earthquake rumbled through the
jungles of southern Sudan on Sunday near the war-torn region's
largest city, but officials said there appeared to be no casualties
and little damage.
   The quake measured 7.5 on the Richter scale. A temblor of that
size is capable of causing widespread destruction.
   The official Sudan News Agency said the earthquake caused no
deaths or injuries. But much of the area affected by the quake is
so isolated that any news might take days or weeks.
   Juba, southern Sudan's largest city, is 60 miles southwest of
the quake's reported epicenter. The region has been hit by famine
as well as fighting between the government and the rebel People's
Liberation Army, and Juba is crammed with refugees from the
7-year-old civil war.
   In Nairobi, Kenya, Bob Koepp, a Lutheran World Federation
official, said a pilot flying relief supplies to Juba returned late
Sunday and said the city had not been seriously affected. He said
there was some ``negligible'' damage.
   ``It wasn't very heavy at Juba. The epicenter apparently was in
the swamps and the ground may have just soaked it up,'' Koepp said.
   Scientists said the quake's epicenter was 700 miles south of
Sudan's capital, Khartoum. It occurred in sparsely populated
territory controlled by the rebels, who hold most of the southern
countryside.
   Relief workers in two rebel-controlled villages, Bor and Torit,
apparently told officials in Nairobi, Kenya, the earthquake caused
no damage there.
   ``It's pretty low area over there, with low buildings and quite
remote,'' Koepp said.
   A crew with Koepp's organization landed in the region with
relief supplies two hours after the quake struck at 4:22 a.m. and
reported seeing nothing amiss.
   Late Sunday, a Khartoum airport tower operator said flights to
the southern city had not been disrupted.
   Pierre-Andre Conod of the International Committee of the Red
Cross said he had no details about injuries or damage. He said
colleagues in Juba had not made their regular radio contact with
Khartoum but cautioned that ``maybe they have a problem with the
antenna. We cannot say it is due to the earthquake.''
   People seeking haven from the war and from famine have more than
doubled Juba's population of 125,000. In recent years, hundreds of
thousands have died in southern Sudan, an area the size of Texas.
   Egypt's two principal earthquake monitoring stations, including
one at the Aswan High Dam, 600 miles south of Cairo and just north
of the Sudan border, recorded the quake at 7.5 on the Richter
scale. The U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif. reported an
identical reading.
   ``It's such a big quake that the monitoring stations are
saturated with data,'' said geologist Rashad M. Kebeasy, president
of Egypt's National Research Institute of Astronomy and Geophysics.
``This is an extremely dangerous earthquake. It is the first time
that such a quake has struck this area.''
   He said ``large and very dangerous aftershocks'' were to be
expected for the next two days.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake
as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every
increase of one number, say from magnitude 5.5 to magnitude 6.6,
means that the ground motion is 10 times greater.
   A magnitude of 7 is considered a major earthquake capable of
widespread heavy damage. Magnitude 8 is a great earthquake capable
of tremendous damage. Last October's earthquake near San Francisco
registered 7.1 on the Richter scale.
   Kebeasy, an expert on earthquakes of northeastern Africa, said
the epicenter was just west of the Great African Rift. That
earthquake zone stretches 4,000 miles from Mozambique through the
Red Sea to Lebanon.
   The proximity to the rift accounts for the quake's magnitude,
Kebeasy said.
