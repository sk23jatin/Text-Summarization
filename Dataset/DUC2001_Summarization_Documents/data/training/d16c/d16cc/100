Between January 1988 and June 1990 there were 12 earthquakes in Asia
and two in Africa.  They ranged in magnitude from a quake off Hokkaido
that registered 5.2 on the Richter Scale to a powerful quake in Iran
that registered 7.7 on the scale. The African quakes did not cause
much damage. The Asian earthquakes that caused the most deaths
occurred in Iran, in Armenia, in Tadzhikistan, along the Nepal-India
border, and on the China-Burma border. The Tokyo area experienced a
single quake that measured 5.4, but experts say the great metropolis
is in danger of a major earthquake.  </SUM>
