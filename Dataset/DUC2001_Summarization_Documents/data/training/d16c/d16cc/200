The magnitude of earthquakes is measured on the Richter Scale. An
increase of one whole number on the logarithmic scale represents a
tenfold increase in magnitude.  An earthquake of 7 on the Richter is a
great quake and capable of massive destruction. Four earthquakes of
that magnitude struck in either Asia or Africa between January 1988
and June 1990.  An earthquake measuring 7.7 struck Iran in June 1990,
killing thousands who were sleeping when the quake hit. An earthquake
along the China-Burma border in November 1988. It registered 7.3 and
left 730 dead. In May 1990 Southern Sudan experienced a quake that
registered 7.5 but caused little damage because it hit an isolated
area.  A quake that measured over 7 occurred deep under the sea near
Honshu without causing much damage.

Two quakes caused great destruction even though their magnitudes were
below the 7 level.  Twenty-five thousand were killed in Armenia, and
at least another 1,000 in Tadzhikistan.  Less devastating quakes
occurred along the India-Burma border, near Luzon, off Hokkaido, in
the Caspian Sea area, and near Tokyo. Tokyo, sitting atop three
tectonic plates, is in grave danger of another devastating earthquake.
