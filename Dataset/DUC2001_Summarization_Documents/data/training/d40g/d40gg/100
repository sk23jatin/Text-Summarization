Following the Gulf War, General Colin Powell was a Pentagon leader
about whom talk began of an electoral career.  Democrats were attuned
to his personal life values: Jamaican immigrant parents, raised in
South Bronx, attended City College of New York, ROTC, wounded twice in
Viet Nam, encouraged support to minorities, battled with
discrimination.  His position on foreign policy and aggressive use of
US forces put him in the mainstream of the GOP.  A senior aide to
three cabinet members, he had served as Deputy National Security
Adviser, National Security Adviser, Commander-in-Chief of the Forces
Command, and Chairman of the JCS.  </SUM>
