   Gen. Colin L. Powell, who is expected to be named
the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is described by
colleagues as a ``soldier's soldier'' who doesn't particularly like
staff jobs.
   The four-star Army general, who became national security adviser
in 1987 and heads the U.S. Forces Command at Fort McPherson in
Atlanta, would become the first black to serve as the nation's
senior military officer.
   The 52-year-old son of Jamaican immigrants, Powell was highly
regarded by President Reagan, succeeding Frank C. Carlucci as
Reagan's national security adviser.
   ``He was the general who guided preparations for the Gorbachev
summits, who helped restructure and give new direction to the
National Security Council following the Iran-Contra investigation,
and who, by his personal integrity and commitment, has restored
confidence in the National Security Council itself,'' said White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Those qualities were cited by The Washington Post in calling
Powell the ``antidote to Ollie North,'' the former NSC aide
convicted in the Iran-Contra scandal.
   ``Colin gets mad at me when I say this, but I think he should go
to the very top of the military establishment _ up to and including
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff,'' Carlucci has said.
   A senior administration official said in Washington on Wednesday
that President Bush is expected to name Powell to the position.
   Powell took over U.S. Forces Command, or FORSCOM, in April,
putting him in charge of troop readiness and deployment for the
U.S. Army. In interviews since then, he has emphasized he's proud
of the accomplishments of the average U.S. soldier over the years.
   In the old days, Powell said, soldiers would keep a pinball
machine in a corner of their barracks. ``Today there's a computer
there.''
   On personal level, however, Powell doesn't always keep up with
the times. You'd only know the 1972 Chrysler station wagon parked
in the general's space each day was his by reading the four-star
decal on its front.
   Washington colleagues have described Powell as a ``soldier's
soldier'' who doesn't like staff jobs. Carlucci says that Powell
has always been reluctant to be a bureaucrat and that Reagan got
Powell to accept the job of national security adviser after the
general had turned Carlucci down several times.
   In his time off, he tells young blacks to spend their lives
helping to open doors for minorities.
   ``Don't squander the blood, sweat and tears of those who paved
the way for you,'' he told Clark Atlanta University graduates this
spring. ``The greatest danger ... is complacency.''
   He tells of his battles with racial discrimination, recalling
the time an Alabama state trooper pulled him over for speeding in
the early 1960s. The trooper looked at the car, complete with New
York plates and an LBJ bumper sticker, and hissed, ``Boy, get out
of here.''
   On the job, Powell emphasizes his commitment to obtaining
resources for his troops, a task he said was top priority when he
became FORSCOM commander.
   As leader of Powell is responsible for the training and
preparedness of more than 1 million active, reserve and National
Guard troops in the United States.
   Powell's daily interests are more pressing: Keeping his troops
ready for combat ``with the hope they will never be needed.''
   And in that position, he keeps a close eye on the Soviet Union.
   ``The Soviets are going through wrenching historic change,
beginning with the irreversible acknowledgement that their system
is broken and has to be changed,'' he said at his FORSCOM
installation. But ``their FORSCOM is strong. We must be strong.''
   Born in New York, Powell completed training in the Airborne and
Ranger schools and served in Germany and Vietnam.
   Commissioned in the infantry in 1958, he was wounded twice
during two tours in Vietnam, once falling into a trap lined with
sharpened bamboo sticks and impaling a foot.
   His decorations include the Distinguished Service Medal, the
Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart.
   Powell and his wife, Alma, have two daughters and a son.
