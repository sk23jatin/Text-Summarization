Gen. Colin L. Powell, 52, won unanimous approval from the Senate Armed Services 
Committee on Wednesday to be chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with both 
Republicans and Democrats hailing him as an outstanding choice. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate panel voted 20 to 0 to recommend Powell's nomination to the full 
Senate. If confirmed, Powell, who would be the youngest officer to head the 
Joint Chiefs, would replace Adm. William J. Crowe Jr. on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The committee action came after several hours of a confirmation hearing at 
which Powell told the panel that he has "some level of confidence" that reforms 
might succeed in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Such reforms, he said, would give the United States "opportunities to reshape 
our defense programs, our national security policies and our armed forces. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
But he warned that changes in Soviet military capabilities, not budget 
restraints, should prompt the scale-back and called for continued modernization 
of long-range nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very premature to start basing any of our plans and programs and actions" 
on assumptions of Gorbachev's success, said Powell. "But I think it is not 
premature to begin thinking about it." 
</P>
<P>
His comments came as senior Bush Administration officials offered increasingly 
gloomy assessments of Gorbachev's prospects for success. On the eve of a key 
meeting between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign 
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, several U.S. officials have backed away from 
earlier expressions of active U.S. support for the Soviet leader's reform 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expects 'Backward Steps' 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the rising skepticism, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam 
Nunn (D-Ga.) told Powell: "We certainly, I think, have to be prepared for 
backward steps to occur in the Soviet Union. Almost inevitably, we'll have 
disruptions and changes, perhaps with suddenness, perhaps at times with 
violence." 
</P>
<P>
In choosing the 31-year veteran to lead the nation's 2 million troops, 
President Bush skipped over several more senior military officers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an easier decision simply to go down a few numbers, as we say, and pick 
the next senior officer," said Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.), the Senate panel's 
ranking minority member. "But here, a deep selection was made, which conveys to 
me that the President and his principal advisers thought carefully and long 
about this particular selection, and I think it was a wise one." 
</P>
<P>
Echoing praise for Powell, who would be the first black to head the nation's 
military services, Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.) called Powell's appointment 
"one of the finest appointments that our President has made." Nunn said that 
Powell offered "tremendous . . . talent, insight, and experience." 
</P>
<P>
Powell now serves as commander of the U.S. Forces Command, which oversees all 
U.S.-based troops. Those include the active and reserve forces that are slated 
to play a major role in the drug war. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to lawmaker's concerns, Powell said that he would make the 
military's role in the drug war one of his top priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no reservations and I know that none of my colleagues have any 
reservations," said Powell. "The American people have spoken clearly on this 
one. We ought to be concerned about this cancer that is in our midst, and I 
think we do have capabilities to bring to this war," he added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cooperation Over Border 
</P>
<P>
"In Forces Command, I have got people jumping through their butts right now 
trying to see which forces that are available . . . (that) can be diverted from 
other missions, other training activities, to work with the Border Patrol and 
see if we can do a better job of sealing the border between the United States 
and Mexico," said Powell. 
</P>
<P>
Powell told lawmakers that as the President's principal military adviser in a 
time of shrinking budgets, he would "rather have (a force) that is smaller, as 
long as it's always ready to perform, as advertised, and when called upon."
