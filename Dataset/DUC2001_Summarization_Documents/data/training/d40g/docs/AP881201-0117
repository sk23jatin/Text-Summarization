   President Reagan will nominate national
security adviser Colin Powell for promotion to four-star rank and
the post of commander-in-chief of the Army's Forces Command, the
White House and Pentagon announced today.
   The promotion would make the 51-year-old Powell, now a lieutenant
general with three stars, the fourth black officer to attain
four-star rank in the U.S. armed forces. One of those four is
currently on active duty _ Air Force Gen. Bernard P. Randolph.
   The promotion requires Senate confirmation.
   In the new post, Powell would be in charge of all the Army troops
in the continental United States. The command is headquartered at
Ft. McPherson in Atlanta and has traditionally been a major career
stepping stone for senior Army commanders.
   ``President Reagan has the highest respect and affection for
General Powell and wishes him all success in his Army career,''
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in announcing the
nomination. He noted that Powell and Reagan ``have had a close
personal relationship.''
   ``He was the general who guided preparations for the Gorbachev
summits, who helped restructure and give new direction to the
National Security Council following the Iran Contra investigation,
and who, by his personal integrity and commitment, has restored
confidence in the National Seucirty Council itself,'' Fitzwater told
reporters.
   ``General Powell has been a friend and colleague whose advice and
counsel have been valued by all members of the White House staff. He
is a man of rare quality and distinction,'' the spokesman added.
   The spokesman said that Powell is expected to assume command in
April, 1989, when the current commander, Gen. Joseph T. Palastra
Jr., retires. Palastra has held the post since June 1986 and is
retiring after 35 years of active military service.
   After leaving the White House Powell plans to visit a number of
army units before assuming his command, Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman said Powell's new job includes preparing soldiers
for world-wide deployment and to defend the U.S. continent.
   The upcoming promotion was first reported Thursday by the Cox
News Service and confirmed a short while later by administration
officials. The Pentagon later released a short statement announcing
President Reagan's intent to nominate Powell for the job.
   Sources at the Pentagon said the FORSCOM position was one of the
few Army four-star posts scheduled to open in the next few months.
   Powell succeeded Frank C. Carlucci as President Reagan's national
security adviser after Carlucci was tapped to replace the retiring
Caspar W. Weinberger.
   Carlucci was called back to government service by President
Reagan to replace Navy Rear Adm. John M. Poindexter in the wake of
the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages affair. Carlucci immediately
recruited Powell as his deputy, drawing him away from a major
command in Europe, and Powell moved up to the top White House spot
after Carlucci's move to the Pentagon.
   Powell is a graduate of City University in New York and received
an MBA degree from George Washington University in Washington.
   Commissioned in the infantry, he was wounded during both of his
two tours in Vietnam, once falling into a trap lined with sharpened
bamboo sticks, impaling a foot.
   In 1977 Powell was assigned to the Pentagon as an assistant to
the deputy assistant secretary of defense. While later serving as an
assistant to Carlucci in the National Security Council, Powell
received his first star. He went on to become military assistant to
Weinberger before a stint as commander of the Army's Fifth Corps in
Europe.
   Powell's decorations include the Distinguished Service Medal, the
Bronze Star and the Purple Heart.
