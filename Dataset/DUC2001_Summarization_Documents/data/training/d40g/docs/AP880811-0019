   At the White House as elsewhere, Vice
President George Bush's search for a running mate has people
guessing _ and now one of their own is part of the guessing game.
   President Reagan says he's just guessing along with everybody
else.
   ``I don't have a candidate,'' he said Wednesday when asked about
it. ``That's up to him.''
   Reagan also was asked about a newspaper column suggesting his
national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell, as a
possibility for the second spot on the ticket. Powell is the first
black ever to hold the post of national security adviser.
   ``You'd better watch out,'' the president quipped. ``He's
standing right behind you.''
   Powell, stationed behind the group of reporters who were
questioning Reagan during an Oval Office photo opportunity, made no
comment.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked what he thought of
Powell as a vice presidential prospect, said, ``Colin Powell is a
great American and would be an outstanding candidate for any
position. I hope he's listening to this.''
   Fitzwater's daily briefings are piped into the offices of top
White House aides.
   Later, as Reagan bade farewell to visiting Icelandic Prime
Minister Thorsteinn Palsson in the White House East Room, the
question came up again.
   Secretary of Defense Frank C. Carlucci, responding to a
reporter's query, nodded toward Powell and said with a grin, ``He's
my candidate.''
   Powell just grinned and shook his head but said nothing.
   Before he went to the Pentagon, Carlucci had Powell's job, and
Powell was his deputy.
   The most recent thing Powell has said about his future was in a
speech to the World Affairs Council of Los Angeles on July 19.
   ``As for myself,'' he said, ``I expect to go back to a nice
quiet foxhole where I can serve my country in a more comfortable
and perhaps less exposed position.''
   Powell is an army officer and, before becoming Carlucci's deputy
in January 1987, was commanding General of V Corps in Frankfurt,
West Germany.
   The questions about his future were spurred by a column in
Wednesday's Washington post by William Raspberry suggesting that it
would be a ``brilliant idea'' for Bush to pick Powell as his
running mate.
   Despite the jesting tone of the questions and answers, it's not
just a joke.
   Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., who is himself a potential vice
presidential candidate, is among those who have mentioned Powell as
a possible Bush running mate.
   The congressman's press secretary, Marci Robinson, said Kemp
believes Powell would be ``an exciting choice'' with the foreign
affairs and other experience to be able to serve as president if
necessary and that ``politically speaking, it would hit the
Democrats at their strength.''
   Powell is the only current White House aide being mentioned as
even a remote possibility to be Bush's running mate, although
former chief of staff Howard H. Baker Jr. has been reported under
consideration.
   Fitzwater was asked jokingly whether he is interested.
   ``I`m available,'' he replied to laughter. ``I ought to get the
honesty vote. I say it right up front _ I will be vice president.
Just ask. I never disparaged the job. I thought it was terrific
when I was on the staff.''
   Fitzwater was Bush's press secretary before taking his present
job.
