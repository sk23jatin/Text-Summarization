   President Reagan's national security adviser,
Colin Powell, on Thursday credited Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev for pushing economic reform, but said it ``remains to be
seen'' how much improvement can be made under a communist, one-party
system.
   Powell, an Army lieutenant general, said it has become clear,
however, that the Soviets have chosen to pursue a policy of
declining adventurism in foreign policy so they can focus ``energies
and resources on internal economic reform.''
   ``The bold new leadership in the Kremlin has candidly
acknowledged the problems the Soviet system faces,'' Powell said in
a speech prepared for delivery to the National Press Club. ``But the
problems are fundamental, even structural.''
   Soviet officials in Moscow on Thursday said they will begin
liquidating unprofitable businesses and farms to bolster the
nation's economy and overcome a budget deficit expected to reach $58
billion next year.
   Finance Minister Boris Gostev told the Supreme Soviet legislature
that Gorbachev's government is finding it difficult to bring deficit
spending under control.
   In his speech, Powell took his audience on a tour of world
trouble spots, saying resistance forces fighting communism and
totalitarians have made great strides in Afghanistan, Angola, and
Cambodia. But Powell said the push for freedom in Nicaragua has
lagged, at least in part because of divisions within the United
States on support for the Contra rebels.
   He said a principal lesson to be learned from the various
regional conflicts is that American foreign policy has tended to
succeed in instances in which U.S. support was unquestioned. He said
this included Afghanistan, where the Soviets have begun pulling out
forces that have occupied the Southwest Asian nation since 1979 but
were fought continuously by the Mujahedeen resistance.
   ``The Soviets are correctly reassessing their past foreign
policy, including their adventurism in the 1970s, as a series of
mistakes,'' Powell said, because they and their allies were unable
to consolidate their gains.
   ``One lesson here is that sometimes leaders have the wit to see
the futility of war, to see diplomatic solutions,'' he said. ``But
the deeper lesson is that effective resistance to aggression is what
demonstrates the futility of war.''
   Of the changing political climate in the Soviet Union, he said:
``Essentially, perestroika is an acknowledgment of the failure of
the Soviet system to provide for its people. Whether it can be fixed
as long as it remains a communist, one-party system remains to be
seen.''
   But Powell also said that Gorbachev, who recently took on the
additional title of president of the Soviet Union with the
retirement of Andrei Gromyko, is facing problems with ``restive
nationalities in the Soviet Union and around the Soviet empire.''
   This, he said, is going to ``preoccupy Moscow more than anyone
anticipated.''
   ``There is little we can do to affect the Soviet Union's internal
evolution,'' said Powell, who plans to resume his active duty
military career when Reagan's term ends Jan. 20. ``We can encourage
steps that are clearly improvements in Soviet internal political
practice, even if they do not correspond fully to what we know as
democracy.''
   Reagan on Wednesday voiced hope that Gorbachev would free
remaining political prisoners in the Soviet Union _ as West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl had indicated following talks with Kremlin
officials.
   ``Our adversaries face a systemic crisis,'' Powell said. ``They
sense that their system is wrong but they are seeking to fix it
without changing it wholesale. It is not yet clear whether they can
succeed.''
   ``The immediate problem they're facing is an economic system that
is not up to the demands of the 1990s and the 21st century,'' he
said in answer to a question from the audience.
   Powell said the Soviets will be ``left behind'' in global
economic competition ``unless they make the necessarty adjustments.''
