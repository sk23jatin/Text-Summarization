   The nation's top military officer jumped into
the Pentagon budget battle Friday, arguing that hasty cuts in
military spending will end up ``breaking the back'' of America's
defense.
   ``If you suddenly cash in your insurance policy to buy a
so-called peace dividend, you will get neither,'' Gen. Colin
Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a speech to
the National Press Club.
   ``As we get smaller, we also need to get better. If we do it too
fast, we don't get better _ we get hollow,'' he said, warning
against a return to the post-Vietnam War and World War II
reductions.
   Powell's blunt remarks were his first major commentary on the
debate over spending for the nation's military arsenal at a time of
lessened East-West tensions.
   A former national security adviser, Powell now serves as the
president's primary military counselor and coordinator of the
nations' military leaders.
   Powell said that even though the Berlin Wall has fallen and the
Warsaw Pact has nearly evaporated, he has had to place the American
military in dangerous situations during his brief stint in office.
   ``I have been reminded again and again since becoming chairman
that this is still a dangerous world and that you'd better be able
to respond if someone challenges your interests,'' he said, citing
Panama, the Philippines, the Persian Gulf, Europe and Korea as
examples.
   Powell said that despite changes in the Soviet Union, the
Soviets still have the ability to destroy the United States with
nuclear weapons.
   ``We must not confuse a decline in defense spending with a
decline in the nation's enduring defense needs to deal with the
enduring realities we face,'' Powell said.
   The four-star general said that although Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev remains ``very much in charge,'' his policies
``are sowing the seed of his own weakness.''
   The Soviet Union will remain a superpower well into the next
century, Powell said. ``So even as we reduce, we must maintain our
ability to deter and defend,'' he said.
   Powell said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's plan released
earlier this week to cut military forces by 25 percent over five
years shows ``we are willing to examine any reasonable proposal.''
   But the general also defended President Bush's $303.3 billion
spending plan for fiscal 1991 as ``a realistic, prudent response''
to the changing world.
   The administration budget blueprint, Powell said, will begin to
reduce the nation's forces over time. ``On this glide path we will
reach a base force which I believe is not prudent to go below if we
wish to match enduring defense needs with enduring realities,''
Powell said.
   ``We know we will get smaller. That is inevitable, that is the
correct thing to do,`' Powell said. But if Bush's budget request is
cut back significantly, ``You will force us to start breaking the
back of our armed forces,'' he said.
   The general also took aim at lawmakers who are seeking more
severe cuts over a shorter period of time. Although he named no
names, House Armed Services Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., has been
sharply critical of Cheney's 25 percent plan, and Senate Armed
Services Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., has complained about strategic
``blanks'' in Cheney's budget.
   ``We are looking ahead with our eyes open. We're cutting
programs. We want to close bases. We've frozen construction and
hiring. We're cutting troops, and believe it or not _ we're cutting
generals,'' Powell said.
   ``What we need are not more insights on how to trim the margins,
what we need is breathing space. We need to time to make the plans
work,'' Powell said.
