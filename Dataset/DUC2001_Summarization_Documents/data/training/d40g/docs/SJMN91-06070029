<LEADPARA>  ARE DEMOCRATS missing an opportunity by ceding Gen. Colin L. Powell's
political future to the Republican Party?;    With the exhilarating success of
the gulf war, talk is already beginning of possible electoral careers for the
Pentagon leaders burnished by victory. There is ample precedent: Throughout
U.S. history, generals in successful wars -- from George Washington to Ulysses
S. Grant to Dwight D. Eisenhower -- have been rewarded with the White House.
Even if the wars aren't comparable, Powell and Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf have
become true military heroes to a society that has not known any for decades.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Although Florida Republicans are hoping to draft Schwarzkopf for a Senate
bid, he seems unlikely to trade his fatigues for a candidate's general-issue
blue suit. But the silky steeliness displayed during the crisis by Powell, the
first black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has revived discussion of
moving Vice President Dan Quayle out to make room for the general on the 1992
Republican ticket.;    Yet there is some evidence to suggest that if Powell
ever decided to seek elected office, he might be at least as comfortable
running as a Democrat.;    No one, of course, can imagine Powell carrying the
Democratic banner next year against President Bush, his commander-in-chief.
But Powell's ultimate political fate does not now seem likely to be decided in
the coming election.;    It is true that many Republican strategists say
nightly prayers for Bush to replace Quayle with Powell in 1992. In a recent
poll, grass-roots Republicans -- by a resounding 47 percent to 29 percent --
said they would make that trade in a minute.;    But with the gulf war victory
so dramatically strengthening Bush's re-election prospects -- his approval
rating is the highest ever recorded -- few now believe he will dump Quayle.;  
 So if Powell, who is only 53, has a future in national politics it is likely
to come in 1996. And, as the general's career unfolds, Democrats should not
assume his loyalties lie irrevocably with the GOP.;    To begin with, no one
knows Powell's political affiliation. Like many accomplished military
commanders -- Eisenhower throughout the 1940s, for example -- Powell has kept
everyone guessing.;    In the Bronx, N.Y., neighborhood where he is registered
to vote, Powell has not stated a party preference. Though he has prospered in
Republican administrations, he also thrived in the Carter administration.;   
Publicly, Powell brushes aside all questions about his political ideology and
ambitions. Privately, he is no more forthcoming. Even among those on a
first-name basis, people such as retired Maj. Gen. Chuck Bussey, virtually
none can locate where the man stands in a partisan landscape.;    "I know
Colin, and have known him for a long time," says Bussey, who is black. "But I
cannot honestly tell you what are his political positions. I can tell you,
however, that proves how great his political skills are.";    As reticent as
he is, though, Powell has publicly expressed views on enough foreign and
domestic subjects to give some clues of his leanings. Clearly, his positions
on foreign policy and the aggressive use of U.S. force abroad fall within the
mainstream of the GOP, not the post-McGovern Democrats.;    But on domestic
issues, Powell has signaled values that reflect the experiences that shaped
him -- a course that led him down roads many Republicans see only from inside
their cars, with the windows sealed and the doors locked.;    Powell is, after
all, not a product of comfortable suburbia, but a son of Jamaican immigrants
who was born in Harlem, grew up in the South Bronx, watched his parents
struggle to earn a living as a sales clerk and a seamstress in New York's
garment district, attended the public City College of New York and joined the
ROTC during the 1950s, partly because it was one of the few institutions
offering opportunities to blacks.;    Though some blacks have criticized
Powell for being too cautious in addressing issues of concern to
African-Americans, he has, on several occasions, pointedly indicated that he
has not forgotten those struggles. A few years ago, he told a dinner of the
Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies that he was "mindful . . .
that the struggle is not over . . . that the struggle will not be over until
every American is able to find his or her own place in our society, limited
only by his or her own ability.";    More recently, Powell displayed
impatience with the progress of that struggle, when he told a congressional
committee questioning the large number of minority soldiers in the gulf war
that he "wish(ed) that there were other activities in our society . . . as
open as the military is to upward mobility, to achievement, to allowing them
in. I wish that corporate America, I wish the trade unions around the nation,
would show the same level of openness and opportunity to minorities.";    With
his foreign-policy views Powell would scrape against some encrusted
conventions in today's Democratic Party. But Powell's views do not represent a
new mold for the party. Rather, if he choose a political career as a Democrat,
Powell could revive the tattered tradition of the party's Henry "Scoop"
Jackson wing that combined an assertive domestic policy with tough convictions
on defending U.S. interests abroad.;    The bottom line is that Powell
presents intriguing opportunities for both parties. Nominating Powell to a
future national ticket offers Republicans the chance to cement their
presidential majority by breaking the Democratic hold on black votes.;    For
Democrats, conversely, a national slot for Powell could allow the party to
simultaneously affirm its commitment to equal opportunity and dispatch
persistent doubts about whether it is tough enough to protect American
interests in an unstable world.;    If Powell hints even the slightest
interest, and Democrats are uncharacteristically alert, it could set off the
kind of bipartisan bidding war not seen since 1948, when activists in both
parties tried to draft Eisenhower as their presidential candidate. In the
meantime, Americans of all ideologies would be well-served to hear more of
Powell's views on the battles yet to be fought at home. (box)  </TEXT>
