   The cruise ship Song of America was forced to return
to port after an engine seized up and started a small fire, but no
one was hurt, the ship's owner said today.
   The ship left Miami on Sunday with about 1,300 passengers on a
Caribbean cruise.
   On Tuesday, a few hours out of Cozumel, Mexico, one of its four
engines seized up, touching off a fire in the engine room, said
Royal Caribbean Cruise Line spokesman Rich Steck.
   ``Any time you have a fire it's a big deal, but it was quickly
brought under control,'' Steck said. The passengers were mustered on
deck while crew members doused the blaze, but then allowed to resume
the evening's activities, he said.
   The 705-foot ship turned around and returned to Cozumel on its
remaining three engines to replenish firefighting supplies, Steck
said. Passengers stayed aboard, and the Song of America will return
to Miami on Thursday or Friday.
   All passengers will be offered early flights home, along with
full refunds or the chance to book another cruise, Steck said.
