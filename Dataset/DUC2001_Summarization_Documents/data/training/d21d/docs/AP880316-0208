   An engine room fire Wednesday disabled a cruise
ship off the Mexican coast, but the crew extinguished the blaze and
the ship with 715 people aboard was towed to port.
   The Navy cutter Vigilant escorted the 465-foot ship, the
Scandinavian Star, as a precaution, according to Chief Petty
Officer Luis Diaz of the U.S. Coast Guard in Miami.
   ``The fire is out and the ship is being towed by the Mexican
navy to Cancun,'' said Diaz.
   There were no injuries from the fire, but a 71-year-old St.
Petersburg man who suffered a heart attack was in stable condition
and on his way home aboard a Coast Guard plane.
   A second person who suffered a spinal cord injury was also
evacuated with the heart attack victim, but Diaz said that injury
also was apparently not related to the fire.
   The ship was expected to arrive in Cancun late Wednesday or
Thursday. The 449 passengers will be flown to St. Petersburg, said
Jill DeChello, spokesman for the ship's owner, SeaEscape Ltd. of
Miami.
   The Scandinavian Star was on a 3-day cruise to Cozumel, Mexico,
and was returning to St. Petersburg when the fire broke out about 1
a.m. EST Wednesday, she said.
   The crew sealed off the engine room and pumped in carbon dioxide
to put out the fire.
   ``They used all their CO2 and closed off the engine room,'' said
Diaz. ``Then they requested more assistance from the Coast Guard.''
The fire was already extinguished when the Vigilant arrived about
10 a.m., he added.
   Ms. DeChello said the company did not know what sparked the fire.
   ``It will take a week before we know the cause and the extent of
the damage,'' said Ms. DeChello.
   In August 1984, a fire struck the Star's sister ship, the
Scandinavian Sun, in the port of Miami, killing a passenger and a
crewman.
   ``I feel they are two totally different incidents that are in no
way related,'' said Ms. DeChello. She said the cruise line was
inspected by the Coast Guard and rigorously enforced all safety
rules.
   Wednesday's fire occurred as the Scandinavian Star was about 35
miles off Isla Mujeres, a Mexican island north of the tourist
resort Cancun in the Yucatan peninsula, the Coast Guard said.
