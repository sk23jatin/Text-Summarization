<LEADPARA>  'WE'RE in a race with a catastrophe," says Alan Pollock of the National
Transportation Safety Board of efforts to improve cruise vessel safety.;  
What he means, he explained, is that a cruise ship disaster would create
overwhelming pressure for new safety regulations, but he would rather take
preventive action.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Improved cruise ship safety is on the most-wanted list at the board," he
said.;   Sadly, it is true that major steps in ship safety have followed great
disasters: The General Slocum fire, which killed 950 people in 1904, brought
tighter requirements for life-saving gear and fire-fighting equipment; the
Titanic, with its loss of 1,500 lives in 1912, brought rules on life-saving
devices and certifying of lifeboat personnel; in the '30s, the Morro Castle
fire, which cost 124 lives, and the Mohawk sinking, with a loss of 45 lives,
brought regulations on the structure, equipment and materials of passenger
ships.;   The Andrea Doria crash in 1956, in which 47 died, inspired
requirements that ship hulls be divided by steel bulkheads.;   When the
Yarmouth Castle burned and sank in 1965, taking 90 lives, Congress banned wood
construction on passenger ships. And the International Maritime Organization,
a United Nations body with headquarters in London, enacted similar regulations
when it overhauled the Safety of Life at Sea code in 1974.;   Despite these
reforms and improvements, Pollock believes the cruise ship industry has been
lucky there haven't been more fatalities during the last decade.;   "We don't
look at fatalities as a measure of safety," he said.;   "We look at the types
of accidents that occur. Things may go OK under ideal circumstances, but
accidents don't happen under ideal circumstances.";   Pollock fears that
Congress, the Coast Guard and the International Maritime Organization are not
moving fast enough to mandate safeguards, despite 176 deaths last year in an
arsonist's fire on the Scandinavian Star ferry in Denmark, and the dramatic
images of the cruise ship Oceanos, which sank off South Africa early in
August, fortunately without loss of life.;   Safety experts are primarily
concerned with three issues: fire protection, particularly in the big atria of
new cruise ships, the ability of crew members to give safety instructions in a
language that passengers understand, and the aging of the world fleet of
cruise ships.;   American passengers frequently assume that any ship they
board in a U.S. port has met all Coast Guard safety requirements, a notion
reinforced by "Coast Guard approved" labels on most life jackets, and fire
systems on smaller boats and domestic ferries.;   In fact, the Coast Guard
gives four inspections a year to ships that dock in the United States, but
when the vessel is registered in another country, the Coast Guard only makes
sure the ship provides whatever is required by international Safety of Life at
Sea regulations: twice as many lifeboat seats as potential passengers and life
jackets for 125 percent of capacity, with the equipment in good condition.;  
Once a year, the Coast Guard observes an evacuation drill. If equipment is not
in order, the Coast Guard can prevent the boarding of passengers until things
are up to snuff.;   The application of the rules is not universal: the older
the vessel, the less stringent the requirements, because Safety of Life at Sea
rules have grandfather clauses.;   Age: no automatic alarm;   A vessel need
comply only with the rules in effect at the time the keel was laid or it last
underwent major reconstruction. When the rules were initially adopted by the
International Maritime Organization, it was assumed that older vessels would
pass out of service, but this did not happen, according to Marjorie Murtagh of
the Coast Guard, the U.S. fire-safety representative at the International
Maritime Organization.;   Of the 100 large vessels now operating from U.S.
ports -- all but two are of foreign registry -- 72 are more than 10 years old,
23 are more than 20 years old and 26 are more than 30 years old, according to
figures in the Coast Guard magazine Proceedings of the Marine Safety Council.
Thus, 70 percent of vessels visiting the United States need not meet the most
recent international rules, enacted in 1974 to cover ships built after May
1980.;   However, everyone who deals with these figures points out that age is
not an automatic indicator of an unsafe vessel. For instance, the Britanis was
built in 1932 of a steel design not required until after the Andrea Doria.;  
Rear Adm. Joel D. Sipes, former chief of the Coast Guard's Office of Marine
Safety, testified in Congress this spring: "We have been concerned for a
number of years that the grandfather clauses create an incentive to bring more
and more older ships back into service. We already see an aging of the fleet,
and a resurgence in refurbishment without safety upgrading.";   Death rate
falls;   However, the casualty rate on cruise ships has been low in recent
years. The National Transportation Safety Board in 1989 published a study of
36 accidents in 15 years on vessels that touched U.S. ports. Of the 176 deaths
listed, only five were aboard ocean-going cruise vessels under foreign flags.;
  William A. O'Neil, secretary general of the International Maritime
Organization, fears that may change, partly because of the leeway the
grandfather rules give for refitting. "The average age of ships today is 16
years, which is already fairly elderly in shipping terms and old ships need
more maintenance and repair," he said in a statement last month.;   In May,
the safety committee of the International Maritime Organization met in London
to begin amending the Safety of Life at Sea rules.;   The proposed amendments,
which are supported by the majority of the member countries, require that new
ships' atriums have smoke-detection systems, smoke-exhaust systems, two means
of escape and an automatic sprinkler system.;   The committee also discussed a
phase-out of the grandfather rules. One peculiar gap in existing regulations
involves vessels built under the 1974 rules, which banned wood construction,
but for the first time did not require sprinkler systems.;   These vessels
would probably be among the first existing vessels required to install
sprinklers.;   Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the United States have entered
proposals to cover older vessels immediately, or to modify sharply the
permissive rules. Roger Kohn, information officer for the maritime
organization in London, said the loss of the Oceanos "tended to confirm a
general feeling that something must be done.";   John T. Estes, president of
the International Council of Cruise Lines, which represents the owners of most
of the ocean-going cruise vessels, said that his organization favored all the
proposed new rules, but not the proposed effective dates.;   When the safety
committee met in May, it was considering phasing-in dates for the regulations
beyond 1994 for new ships, possibly as late as 2010 for removal from service
of vessels that cannot meet the new rules.;   Estes said that accounting for
the lead time required for ship design, his organization favors 1996 for
enforcing the rules on new construction and major reconstruction.;   The 15
major cruise ships that call in New York have passed inspections without
difficulty, according to Comdr. Anthony Dupree, chief of the inspection
department of the Coast Guard in New York. In U.S. ports, he said, any work is
generally done quickly "because passengers are the lines' meat and potatoes,
and we can keep them from boarding.";   These inspections, done every three
months, should assure passengers, according to Lieut. Comdr. John J. O'Brien
Jr., the Coast Guard's deputy chief.;   "If you fly to another country to save
a few dollars," he said, "let the buyer beware; you don't know if it's been
inspected in the last year, or at all.";   On the other hand, when
U.S.-registered vessels are inspected, O'Brien said, they are required to meet
full Coast Guard standards, including expensive Type I life vests designed to
be very easy to use. But there are only two U.S.-flag vessels in the cruise
trade -- American Hawaii Cruises' Independence and Constitution, operating in
Hawaii.  </TEXT>
