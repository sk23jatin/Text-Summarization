   Fire broke out aboard a Soviet passenger liner
carrying French tourists on a cruise of the Mediterranean, but the
blaze was put out by the crew and no passengers were injured, Tass
reported Monday.
   The Shota Rustaveli was 25 miles off the island of Malta when a
blaze broke out in the auxiliary engine room, the official news
agency said.
   ``The blaze was put out by the crew. There are no casualties
among the passengers,'' Tass said.
   It cited local news reports as saying the ship had docked at the
Maltese port of Valletta, and that its passengers had been offered
sightseeing trips around the island south of Sicily.
   The tourists were expected to continue their voyage on another
Soviet ship, and the crew of the Shota Rustaveli was to make
repairs and bring the ship home, Tass said.
   It was the second fire aboard a Soviet cruise ship in recent
months. On May 18, a blaze broke out on the liner Priamurye while
it was in the Japanese port of Osaka. Eleven Soviets were killed in
the Priamurye fire, and 26 others hospitalized in critical
condition, Tass reported. The ship was carrying 295 Soviets on a
youth cruise around Japan.
