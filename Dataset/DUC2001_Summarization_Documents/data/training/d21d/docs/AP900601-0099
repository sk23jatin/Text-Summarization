   Someone set a fire early today in a storage
room on the luxury liner Regent Star, five days after the ship ran
aground in Delaware Bay because of another fire that cut off power,
authorities said.
   No passengers were aboard and no injuries were reported in the 5
a.m. blaze, which was controlled within 90 minutes, said Patrick
McKee, a dispatcher for the city fire department.
   ``The fire on the Regent Star was started in a maintenance
storage room,'' said Lt. Jack Christmas, a fire department
spokesman. ``The fire marshal investigating has determined ... that
the fire was intentionally set.''
   There were no immediate suspects and no immediate evidence to
indicate that the fire was linked to the earlier fire, Christmas
said.
   The 20,000-ton liner was on its way from Jamaica to Philadelphia
on Sunday when a small fire prompted a power loss, allowing the ship
to drift onto a sandbar.
   The 885 passengers left the ship by ferry Monday, a day after
they were supposed to return. No one was injured.
   The liner was freed Tuesday, and the ship was then docked while
the Coast Guard makes safety checks. Thursday, Coast Guard Petty
Officer Ken Beatty said the ship passed all inspections and there
was no serious damage from the grounding.
   The ship had been due to start on a two-day cruise later today,
but that was canceled after the second fire broke out, authorities
said.
   The Coast Guard has said it might be months before a final report
on the grounding is complete.
   An hour after this morning's fire was controlled, about 300 crew
members sat or stood in small groups alongside the Port of History
Museum where the ship was tied up. Many still wearin the orange life
preservers they had put om when they abandoned the ship. Others were
sitting on the preservers.
   Many of them said they didn't speak English, and one who did
refused to be identified and said he didn't know anything about what
happened.
