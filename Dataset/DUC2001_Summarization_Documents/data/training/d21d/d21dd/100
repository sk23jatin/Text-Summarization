There is increasing concern in the National Transportation Safety Board that there needs 
to be major improvements in the cruise ship industry to avert a major disaster. The 
board's primary concern is fire protection.

In 1988, the chairman of a federal agency investigating a March engine-room fire aboard 
the Scandinavian Star said safety standards may not be stringent enough in the cruise 
industry.  Since then, many incidents have occurred that could have caused serious loss of 
life. 
 
The NTSB is pushing for legislation that would give the U.S. Coast Guard the authority 
to enforce U.S. safety rules on foreign-flag vessels calling at U.S. ports.
