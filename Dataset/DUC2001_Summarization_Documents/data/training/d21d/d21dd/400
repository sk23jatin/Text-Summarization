"We're in a race with a catastrophe," says Alan Pollock of the National Transportation 
Safety Board on efforts to improve cruise ship safety.  He said a cruise ship disaster 
would create overwhelming pressure for new safety regulations, but he would rather take 
preventive action.

Safety experts are primarily concerned with fire protection, the ability of crew members 
to give safety instructions in a language that passengers understand, and the aging of the 
world fleet of cruise ships.

There has not been a significant loss of life in cruise ship incidents in the recent past but 
there is increasing concern that a major disaster could occur at any time.

In 1988, the chairman of a federal agency investigating a March engine-room fire aboard 
the Scandinavian Star said safety standards may not be stringent enough in the cruise 
industry.  Since then, many incidents have occurred that could have caused serious loss of 
life. 

In 1991, more than 3,000 passengers and crew were evacuated from the Sovereign of the 
Seas after a fire broke out in a pantry.  One crewman suffered from smoke inhalation, but 
there were no other injuries in the fire.

In the same year, Miami-based Carnival Cruise Lines' 700-foot Celebration cut a Cuban 
freighter in half in a collision off Cuba, killing three Cuban sailors.

In other incidents, the Song of America with 1,300 passenger on board was forced to 
return to port after an engine seized up and started a small fire. The Regent Star ran 
aground in the Delaware Bay after a fire cut off power to the ship in 1990.

There were fires on two Soviet passenger ships in 1988. One ship carried French tourists 
in the Mediterranean while the other ship was in port Osaka. 

In July 1986, an acetylene-fueled fire erupted in an engine store room on the Panamanian 
cruise ship Emerald Seas causing two explosions.  The ventilation system, instead of 
shutting down, pumped black smoke into the state rooms causing forty-one people to be 
treated for smoke inhalation.

Currently, there are only two U.S. registered Cruise ships.  To reduce the chances of a 
cruise-ship disaster, the NTSB is pushing for legislation that would give the U.S. Coast 
Guard the authority to enforce U.S. safety rules on foreign-flag vessels calling at U.S. 
ports.  

The NTSB knows that despite their efforts it could be years before the safety standards 
for cruise ships are upgraded.
