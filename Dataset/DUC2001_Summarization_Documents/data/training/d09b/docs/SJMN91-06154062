<TEXT>  IRAQI President Saddam Hussein has sought to tighten his grip on power by
turning over key government roles to trusted family members.;    He has also
taken steps to portray Iraq as committed to "democratization" by:;    (check)
Holding autonomy talks with Kurdish leaders.;    (check) Abolishing the secret
Revolutionary Court.;    (check) Easing restrictions on travel and news
organizations.;    (check) Promising to hold elections and disband the ruling
Revolutionary Command Council.;    Threatened by the revolts of the Kurds in
the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south, as well as rumblings in the
army, he has closed his circle around him.;    Since Iraq's defeat, Saddam has
adjusted his Cabinet twice, shifting the portfolios of longtime senior
officials and promoting others known for their loyalty to him.;    On the
surface, the reshuffling looked as if he were moving to democratize.;    In
March, for example, he relinquished the title of prime minister and gave it to
Saadun Hamadi, a Shiite who has held several important positions in the Baath
government.;    Personal loyalty seems to be the litmus test for Saddam's new
appointees:;    (check) His cousin, Ali Hassan al-Majid, is minister of
interior.;    (check) His half-brother, Sibawi, retains direct control of the
intelligence services.;    (check) Son-in-law and former bodyguard Hussein
Kamel al-Majid is his minister of defense.;    Publicly, Saddam is seen on
Iraqi television presiding over meetings of the Revolutionary Command Council
and visiting villages, and he has promised his people to rebuild the country
"scores of times" better than what the allied forces destroyed.;    But most
experts see Saddam's efforts as aimed at reviving relations with the outside
world and at relieving some of the pressure at home. Only the autonomy talks
with the Kurds are considered serious.; IRAQ; MONTHS OF SANCTIONS ARE TAKING
THEIR TOLL; IRAQ'S economy was severely damaged by the war, and the trade
sanctions imposed by the United Nations shortly after Iraq invaded Kuwait last
August are starting to take a toll.;    Iraq is allowed to import food and
medicine under the sanctions. But until it can export its oil, it will have
little cash to obtain reasonably priced supplies of basic necessities.;   
Many of the goods coming into the country are being bought by private
businessmen with hard currency they stockpiled before the war. They must in
turn sell the goods at high prices to make a profit.;    An ambassador from a
Third World country, who spoke on condition of anonymity, predicted that if
the sanctions were continued six more months it would increase the threat of
internal unrest in Iraq.;    President Bush has said the sanctions will remain
as long as Saddam Hussein is in power. But so far, there is no clear
alternative to Saddam.;    In the meantime, government officials have told
people to brace for the worst.;    Iraqis line up for rationed food and
gasoline and try to make ends meet by taking on second jobs.;    The official
exchange rate for the Iraqi dinar is $3.20. But on the street, it takes 3 to 6
dinars to buy one dollar.;    Before sanctions were imposed in August, two
pounds of rice cost one-fifth of a dinar. Today, it costs 6 dinars. Two pounds
of meat went from 6 dinars in December to 14 now. Tea costs 15 times more now
than it did then.;    The average monthly salary is about 150 dinars, or $480
at the official exchange rate.;    Many small factories have closed or reduced
operations because of shortages.;    Businesses have been told not to expect
help from the government and to rely on their own resources.;    THE
ENVIRONMENT; WAR LEAVES GULF IN ECOLOGICAL RUINS; THE environmental upheaval
caused by the Persian Gulf war is of such proportion and complexity that the
word "disaster" seems to trivialize it. The damage is everywhere: in air,
water, earth and fire.;    Smoke and soot continue to pour from hundreds of
oil wells set ablaze by the fleeing army of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.;  
 KUWAIT; WAR-RAVAGED NATION IS SLOW TO REBUILD; KUWAIT is lacking in
leadership, stripped of its workforce, gutted of supplies and apparently in
little hurry to do anything about it.;    Hundreds of homes, shops, offices,
schools and power plants have been looted -- but not leveled. The estimated
cost of rebuilding has fallen from $100 billion to about $14 billion.;    But
Kuwaiti society seems utterly directionless.;    Few government employees are
back at work. About half the old workers were foreigners, especially
Palestinians, who either fled the country during the war or have been ordered
by the Kuwaiti government to stay off work because of alleged Iraqi
sympathies. Most of the Kuwaiti employees still live abroad.;    The business
areas remain littered with rubble and broken glass. Heavy lifting and sweeping
up are the sort of menial tasks previously left to Filipinos and Bangladeshis,
most of whom left the emirate after the invasion.;    In fact, of the nearly
1.5 million foreigners who lived here a year ago, only about 250,000 remain.; 
  Shortages of basic supplies such as water, electricity and hotel rooms have
hampered efforts by Western companies to make contacts and sign contracts.;   
Last week, the government announced the extension of martial law for another
month, and the prime minister ordered a crackdown on armed vigilantes who have
been rounding up foreigners suspected of collaborating with Iraqi occupation
forces.;    The government itself has contributed to the tension, holding the
first trials of alleged collaborators and handing out harsh sentences for
apparently trivial crimes.;    Western diplomats predict the regime may face
an uprising if the ruling Sabah family fails by year's end to call elections
for a new parliament.;    THE U.S. MILITARY; HIGH-TECH WEAPONS, NEW WAR PLAN
WORKED; THE Pentagon's fascination with sophisticated weaponry appears to have
won a ringing endorsement, thanks to the convincing victory over Iraq. But so
did the revolutionary restructuring of the way the Pentagon commands a war,
forged by Congress five years ago over bitter Defense Department opposition.; 
  The volunteer military proved itself during the conflict, as did the Army's
AirLand Battle doctrine, a previously untested scheme for melding the Army and
Air Force into a fighting force capable of defeating a more numerous foe.;   
Many in the Pentagon are grinning ear-to-ear over the successes in the 43-day
war. But they've also had to acknowledge some unexpected lessons:;    (check)
The Air Force's A-10 Thunderbolt anti-tank plane -- long denigrated by the
service for its lumbering style and ugly profile that earned it the moniker
"Warthog" -- became its star.;    (check) The vital importance of adequate
ships and planes to ferry troops and weapons to battle -- long derided by a
Navy more enamored of aircraft carriers and battleships -- was underscored.;  
 (check) The wisdom of a new law strengthening the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, although originally strenuously opposed by the military,
proved crucial to the quick, decisive triumph.;    (check) The value of at
least some aspects of the limping "star wars" program. This includes the
Patriot missiles that were used to counteract Iraqi Scud attacks, though
questions have arisen about just how effective the Patriot was in actually
destroying Scuds.;    But while establishing the prowess of American aircraft
and missiles, the war did little to answer questions about Army hardware,
including the M-1 tank and the Bradley Fighting Vehicle.;    Also untested
were the Marine Corps' new machines for amphibious attack -- large air-cushion
hovercraft designed to carry troops and heavy equipment from ship to shore.
While the threat of a landing tied down six Iraqi divisions defending the
Kuwait coast, there was no amphibious assault from the Persian Gulf.;   
REFUGEES; KURDS HEADING BACK TO HOMES IN NORTH IRAQ; RAGGED and weary, Iraqi
refugees are returning home at the rate of 10,000 a day.;    Roughly 1.7
million of Iraq's 3.5 million Kurds fled to Iran and Turkey during civil
uprisings in late March and early April. In the last two weeks, most of those
on the Turkish border have made their way back to the principal northern Iraqi
cities of Zakho and Dohuk.;    Relief officials and allied troops Saturday
closed the last camp on the Turkish-Iraqi border. Six other camps were emptied
in recent days.;    Figures are sketchy, but the allied command estimates that
fewer than 10 percent of 450,000 Kurds who fled to the Turkish border are
still displaced.;    But there are no accurate assessments of what has
happened to 1.2 million more Kurds who settled in Iranian camps. Iranian
officials were not partners in an international relief effort to help the
Kurds, and information from that region has been difficult to verify.;    And
there are indications that thousands of southern Iraqis may never go home.
Roughly 70,000 Shiite refugees from the Basra region are believed to still be
encamped in Iran because they fear reprisals from Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
About 20,000 other Shiites are living in a camp in Saudi Arabia.;    In all,
roughly a quarter of Iraq's 19 million people were either routed from their
homes or lost their jobs as a result of the gulf war, according to estimates
from several relief agencies.;    In the first major assessment of the war,
the environmental group Greenpeace reported last week that as many as 221,000
Iraqi people died as a result of the war and its aftermath. That toll
includes: 100,000 to 120,000 Iraqi troops; 5,000 to 15,000 Iraqi civilians;
20,000 Kurdish and Shiite insurgents; and 15,000 to 30,000 refugees.;    And a
team from Harvard University recently visited Iraq and forecast that more than
170,000 children will die in the coming months from disease and war-related
traumas.;    BURNING WELLS; 500 FIRES STILL RAGE ON KUWAITI OIL FIELDS; Crews
capped the 100th well last weekend in the smoke-darkened gloom of Kuwait's
blazing oil fields, about 20 wells ahead of schedule.;    Oil experts and
firefighters are now predicting that at least half the 500 oil fires still
blazing could be out by the end of summer.;    The four companies fighting the
fires estimate that it will take 13 more months to put out all the fires -- a
much shorter amount of time than had been feared when the world first glimpsed
the awesome spectacle of Kuwait's 600 burning oil wells.;    The current pace
of two wells per day is expected to slow in the coming weeks, however, as
crews turn their attention to the most badly damaged wells. Those could take
up to a month each to control.;    Badly damaged wells will have to be
redrilled. That costs a minimum of $600,000 to $700,000 each.;    Crews have
not yet been able to enter the heart of the Burgan oil field, the most densely
drilled reservoir in the world, where as many as 300 fires are blazing
unchecked. Routes into that field are studded with unexploded cluster bombs
dropped by allied warplanes during the war and have been covered by oil
spewing from damaged wells.;    One well is burning in a blazing oil pool that
is two-thirds of a mile across and growing.;    Puffs of white smoke are
beginning to appear among the dense black clouds billowing from the fields,
ominously indicating the presence of water in the reservoir beneath. If the
water has mixed with the reservoir, Kuwait's oil will, in the future, have to
go through additional processes to strip it of its water content, increasing
production costs.;    Kuwait may lose 10 percent to 20 percent of its reserves
of about 92 billion barrels. But the country should still be producing oil
into the late 21st century.  </TEXT>
