   Late July: George Steinbrenner is still
running the Yankees, the governor of Louisiana is deciding whether
to veto an abortion bill and the first tropical disturbance of
summer, a storm named Arthur, makes its appearance in the Caribbean.
   The American press seems bent on finding out who David Souter is
and what his thoughts are about abortion. President Bush has just
nominated him to the Supreme Court.
   Few Americans much notice that Saddam Hussein of Iraq is
accusing his small neighbors of harboring an ``imperial-Zionist
plan'' to drive down the price of oil.
   Don't blame yourself if you missed the rumblings that were to
suddenly put the United States on war footing and land a vast
military force on the searing Saudi desert, where American troops
had never before been welcomed.
   What led to that, the quarrel between Iraq and its little
neighbor, Kuwait, just seemed like another of those wrangles over
oil production and pricing that occur before the meetings of OPEC
sheiks and statesmen.
   Oil? Wasn't there a glut?
   War? Wasn't this the era of the peace dividend?
   The oil glut was the problem for Saddam Hussein of Iraq. After
eight years of war with Iran, ended by a cease-fire, his country
was powerful but broke. Oil prices and oil revenues were falling.
   Saddam found a pair of villains _ Kuwait, his wartime supporter
and financier, and the United Arab Emirates. Kuwait is just across
the border; the UAE is tucked away on the other side of Saudi
Arabia.
   Kuwait and the UAE were in fact, as Saddam Hussein charged,
exceeding their OPEC oil production quotas by over a million
barrels a day and thus helping to keep oil prices depressed. Oil
was bringing $14 a barrel, 20 percent lower than the year before.
   That was the background to the events that brought out the
battleships, the troops _ and the gas masks.
   July 17: Saddam uses the 22nd anniversary of the coup that
brought his Baath Party to power to lay out his demands. He wants
Kuwait to forgive $15 billion in loans extended during the
Iran-Iraq war. And he wants Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates to
pay $14 billion to compensate for what he says Iraq lost due to low
oil prices.
   ``If words fail to protect Iraqis, something effective must be
done to return things to their natural course and return usurped
rights to their owners,'' he says. ``Iraqis will not forget the
maxim that cutting necks is better than cutting the means of
living. Oh, God Almighty, be witness that we have warned them.''
   July 18: A letter from Saddam's foreign minister to the Arab
League accuses Kuwait of having stolen $2.4 billion worth of
petroleum over the past decade from an Iraqi oil field along the
two nations' disputed border.
   Kuwait puts its 20,000-man army on alert.
   July 19: Kuwait cancels its state of alert. ``It was all a
summer cloud that has been blown away,'' says an unidentified
Kuwaiti source who turns out to be monumentally wrong.
   July 20: Thousands of Kuwaiti workers in Iraq, sensing trouble,
head home.
   July 22: A pro-government newspaper in Iran, in a surprise show
of support for a former enemy, says a ``means of punishment against
quota violators seems a necessity.''
   July 23: Unconfirmed reports say that Iraq has massed 30,000
troops to its border and that the Pentagon has put its warships in
the Persian Gulf on alert.
   July 24: Iraq accuses Kuwait of stealing Iraqi oil. Kuwait
reinstates its alert. The Pentagon announces naval exercises in the
Persian Gulf.
   July 25: President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, seeking to carve out
a peacemaker's role, says Iraq and Kuwait have agreed to send
delegations to the Saudi Arabian summer capital of Jiddah to
discuss their differences.
   July 27: At a tense meeting in Geneva, OPEC agrees to limit oil
production and raise its target price by $3 to $21 a barrel. Kuwait
and the United Arab Emirates promise to abide by the new production
quotas. Because of Iraq's threats to use force against countries
that ignore the limits, industry observers expect the measure, this
time, to stick.
   In Washington, the House and Senate defy Bush administration
opposition and vote for economic sanctions against Iraq. These
reflect an accumulation of complaints over Iraq's attempt to
intimidate neighbors, its human rights record, its use of poison
gas during the Iran-Iraq war against its Kurdish minority, its
drive to build nuclear weapons. The State Department says the votes
will not be helpful to diplomatic efforts to modify Saddam's
behavior.
   Aug. 1 _ Talks in Jiddah start with an embrace. But two hours
later, they break off. The Iraqi delegation walks out, saying they
did not sense ``any seriousness'' from the Kuwaitis. Tensions _ and
oil prices _ rise.
   Aug. 2 (7 p.m. EDT Aug. 1) _ Tank-led Iraqi infantry units storm
into Kuwait. They advance unchecked down a highway across the flat
desert terrain to the capital, Kuwait city.
   The Financial Times says the advance is so unchallenged that
some troops travelled down the road by bus. The emir, Sheik Jabir,
flees by helicopter. Kuwait's hopelessly outnumbered troops wage
pitched battles around the sheik's residential palace. The sheik's
younger brother is reported to have been killed defending the
palace.
   Kuwait's crown prince and premier, Sheik Saad al-Abdallah Al
Sabah, goes on the radio and television and calls for resistance:
``Let them taste the chalice of death.''
   Kuwait calls for urgent American military assistance but Iraq
threatens to turn Kuwait into a ``graveyard'' if an outside power
intervenes.
   The invasion seems to catch Washington by surprise, but the CIA
takes the unusual step of issuing a statement saying it was not
surprised and had ``provided policy-makers with very useful and
timely information.''
   President Bush reacts swiftly. First he condemns Saddam's
``naked aggression.'' Then he engineers a United Nations-sanctioned
embargo of Iraq. Finally, he commits massive American force, the
largest dispatched since the Vietnam war, to protect Saudi Arabia
from Kuwait's fate. He says they will serve until Saddam withdraws
from Kuwait.
   By now the story has captured America's attention. The latest
developments are writ large on the front pages.
