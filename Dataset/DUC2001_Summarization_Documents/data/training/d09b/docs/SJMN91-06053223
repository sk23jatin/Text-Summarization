<TEXT>     Iraq's half-million troops must complete their withdrawal within one week,
and Baghdad must free all prisoners of war in the first 48 hours. Coalition
forces will not attack withdrawing troops, the White House said.;    Bush's
attempt to dictate terms drew strong support from congressional leaders as
well as from officials in London and Paris, key allied capitals.;    In
Moscow, officials unveiled a refinement of their day-old peace plan, moving
closer but not meeting the coalition terms. Claiming support from Iraqi
Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz, a Soviet spokesman said the plan envisioned a
total withdrawal within 21 days of a cessation of hostilities.;    Saddam must
signal "publicly and authoritatively" his acceptance of the allied withdrawal
terms, Bush said. He accused the Iraqi leader of launching a "scorched earth
policy" in Kuwait by setting fires in the oil fields.;    There was no
immediate response from the Iraqi president, and Fitzwater said that based on
the oil-field destruction, there was "not much reason for optimism" that
Saddam was ready to quit the war.;    More than 700,000 allied troops are
deployed against Iraq in the sands of Saudi Arabia, and officials said all is
in readiness for an overwhelming assault by air, land and sea against Iraqi
forces entrenched in Kuwait.;    "Any breach will bring an instant and sharp
response from coalition forces," the spokesman said.;    "High noon" would be
marked by clocks at the United Nations, EST, and Fitzwater suggested Saddam
should communicate his acceptance of the conditions to the U.N. Noon in New
York is 8 p.m. in Saudi Arabia and 9 a.m. local time.;    At noon today, U.S.
officials summoned Iraqi diplomat Khalid Shewayish and presented the list of
requirements for a cease-fire. "This goes to Saddam Hussein," said Fitzwater,
"The ball is in his court.";    He said he wouldn't telegraph in advance when
ground action might begin.;    What's in it for Saddam?, Fitzwater was asked.
"A chance to save his country," he replied.;    Shortly after Bush issued the
allied ultimatum, a Soviet spokesman in Moscow announced a new six-point set
of provisions he said were agreed to by Aziz for a withdrawal from Kuwait.;   
The provisions include Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait within 21 days of a
cease-fire and supervision of the withdrawal by the United Nations, Vitaly
Ignatenko said.;    In his initial statement, Ignatenko made no reference to
Bush's ultimatum.;    Ignatenko told the hastily called news conference that
Soviet officials and Aziz had come up with a "number of new provisions" on the
peace proposal first set forth Thursday night.;    Ignatenko said the plan had
been passed on to Baghdad and that a final response to it from the Iraqi
leadership was anticipated.;    Asked about the response of Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev to Bush's ultimatum, Ignatenko said, "It's the proposal just
outlined.";    Among the requirements for Iraq, said Fitzwater, was that
withdrawal from Kuwait City must be complete within 48 hours and from the
country of Kuwait in one week.;    Iraq also must release all prisoners of war
and third-country civilians within 48 hours and remove booby traps and mines
from Kuwait.;    Fitzwater's list did not touch on the issue of war
reparations, or discuss what military equipment, if any, the Iraqis would be
forbidden to take back to Iraq with them.;    Bush's statement was his first
public response to a Soviet-brokered peace plan -- an effort the president
said he appreciated, even while he declared that it attached unacceptable
conditions on an Iraqi withdrawal.;    Bush said he had consulted with
Operation Desert Storm coalition leaders and they had agreed to the demands
for Iraq's withdrawal.;    "We must hear publicly and authoritatively his
acceptance of these terms," Bush said. He accused Saddam of launching a
"scorched earth policy" in Kuwait by setting fires in the oil fields.;    "The
time has come to make public with specificity just exactly what is required of
Iraq if a ground war is to be avoided," Bush said.;    Bush said Saddam "risks
subjecting the Iraqi people to further hardship unless the Iraqi government
complies fully" with the demands.;    At the Pentagon, a senior military
official said the diplomatic activity was not derailing the allied war plans.;
   "Desert Storm continues to swirl on, regardless," the official said. "We
have our plan and we continue to follow it. Round-the-clock air attacks
continue.";    Bush made his comments as members of the allied coalition
arrayed themselves against Iraq and lawmakers were offering their own
assessments.;    Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Kurtcebe Alptemocin told
reporters before meeting with Bush at the White House that "we should not
allow him (Saddam) to withdraw heavy weapons, especially chemical weapons." He
conceded that imposing such a condition on any settlement "will be very
difficult.";    Of the original Soviet-brokered peace initiative, British
Prime Minister John Major said it was "not good enough" but still an
improvement worth studying. France said the Soviet plan "represents a step in
the right direction.";    Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said the
Soviet-sponsored talks with Iraq are "not in our best interest at all.";   
Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., said the proposed peace plan had "very positive
aspects" but also "plenty of things wrong with it," chiefly a call for lifting
sanctions on Iraq.;    The original Soviet-Iraqi peace plan followed days of
diplomacy between Moscow and Baghdad.  </TEXT>
