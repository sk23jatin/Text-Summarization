Iraq, with a million-plus-man army and modern weapons, was very
powerful but broke.  As oil prices fell, so did Iraq's revenue.
Saddam Hussein blamed the problem on Kuwait and the UAE for exceeding
oil quotas.  On August 2, 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait and several days
later announced its annexation.  President Bush then began a major
U.S.  military buildup in the region to protect the threatened Saudi
Arabia from a similar fate.

The United Nations condemned Iraq's aggression and imposed a total
trade embargo against it in order to force withdrawal from Kuwait.  In
an attempt to launch negotiations and also to rally Arab support,
Saddam tied any Iraqi withdrawal to a comparable Israeli withdrawal
from occupied Arab lands.  The U.N. and U.S. rejected this linkage and
regional Arab nations remained firm in their support of Kuwait and
Saudi Arabia.  Diplomatic initiatives by the Soviet Union and Jordan
failed.  Some cracks appeared in the embargo as Cuba and Romania
continued doing business with Iraq.  The Kuwaiti government in exile
asked the United States to enforce the U.N. embargo.  President Bush
said he would do what was necessary and continued the feverish
U.S. military buildup in the region.  Saddam said he would fight.

In January 1991, Iraq did not satisfactorily respond to a
U.S. ultimatum to begin an immediate withdrawal from Kuwait, release
hostages and comply with U.N. sanctions.  Consequently, U.S. led
allied forces launched a massive air attack against Iraq's
infrastructure and military forces.  Iraq retaliated by launching Scud
missiles against Saudi Arabia and Israel.  After more than a month of
intensive around-the-clock bombing, U.S. led allied ground forces
attacked Iraqi troops in Kuwait.  The ground war proceeded with
surprising speed and success. Thousands of prisoners were taken in the
first hours of fighting.  Within days the Iraqi army was defeated.
Saddam Hussein was forced to accept the United Nations conditions for
a settlement.

The U.N. is committed to implementing a policy of destroying all
remaining Iraqi chemical and biological weapons and missiles and
diminishing their regional influence.  Economic sanctions will
continue until war reparations requirements are fulfilled.  It is
expected that Saddam Hussein will try to obstruct these efforts.

American military superiority has been proven.  However, postwar
political questions remain.  How long will Saddam remain in power?
Will anti-Western sentiment cause problems for our Arab allies?  Can
Israeli-Palestinian issues be resolved?  What role will Iran attempt
to play in regional issues?  </SUM>
