On August 2, 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait and several days later
announced its annexation.  President Bush then began a major
U.S. military buildup in the region to protect Saudi Arabia.

The United Nations condemned Iraq's aggression and imposed a total
trade embargo in order to force its withdrawal from Kuwait.  To rally
Arab support, Saddam tied any Iraqi withdrawal to a comparable Israeli
withdrawal from occupied Arab lands.  This effort failed.  Regional
Arab nations remained firmly against Iraq.  Diplomatic initiatives by
the Soviet Union and Jordan also failed.

In January 1991, after months of failed diplomatic efforts, U.S. led
allied forces launched a massive air attack against Iraq's
infrastructure and military forces.  Following more than a month of
intensive around-the-clock bombing, U.S. led allied ground forces
attacked Iraqi troops in Kuwait.  The ground war proceeded with
surprising speed and success. Within days the Iraqi army was defeated.
Saddam Hussein accepted U.N.  conditions for a settlement.  All
remaining Iraqi chemical and biological weapons and missiles must be
destroyed.  Economic sanctions against Iraq will continue until war
reparations requirements are fulfilled.

How long will Saddam remain in power?  Can Israeli-Palestinian issues
now be resolved?  What role will Iran attempt to play in regional
issues?  </SUM>
