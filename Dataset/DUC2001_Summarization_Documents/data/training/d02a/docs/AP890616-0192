   Michael Milken, the fallen Drexel Burnham Lambert
financier, is striking out on his own.
   But what isn't clear is whether loyal ex-colleagues will follow
the Pied Piper of junk bonds to his new firm _ and how long the
venture will last with Milken facing a lengthy jail term.
   Milken, 42, resigned Thursday after 19 years at Drexel, where he
began a wildly successful career that helped reshape corporate
America in the 1980s through the pioneering use of low-grade
securities called junk bonds.
   Milken, who made a reported $550 million in 1987, said he is
forming a consulting firm to assist companies that want to raise
money to start up, grow or stay in business.
   But he faces $1.85 billion in forfeitures of alleged illegal
profits and a lengthy jail term if convicted on a 98-count fraud and
racketeering indictment, the government's largest securities crime
prosecution to date.
   People involved in Milken's plans for the new firm, International
Capital Assets Group, said Milken does not intend to raid Drexel's
Beverly Hills, Calif., junk bond division, which he founded and ran
until his March indictment.
   The principals in the new firm, which now has a handful of
employees and a temporary Los Angeles office, are not going to be
``Drexel people,'' Milken associates said.
   But Milken still commands tremendous loyalty among some key junk
bond employees and Drexel clients, and no one is ruling out
defections. Milken associates did not release details on his plans,
including whether an affiliated brokerage would be formed.
   A Drexel official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Wall Street giant does not anticipate conflicts with Milken's new
firm because it will not be in the brokerage business.
   Under Drexel's still-to-be-approved settlement of civil insider
trading and other fraud charges with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Drexel and its employees are barred from doing business
with Milken, directly or indirectly.
   The Drexel official said the provision likely will be reviewed on
a case-by-case basis, so some contact between the New York
investment firm's clients and Milken may occur. For instance, Milken
may be able to refer clients to Drexel and vice versa but not
receive any fees.
   Milken's resignation ends the relationship between one of the
most important financial players of the decade and the firm he
helped boost from a second-tier brokerage to the nation's fifth
largest.
   ``Michael Milken made many important contributions to Drexel
Burnham, and his resignation, although not unexpected, is a sad
event,'' Drexel stated. ``We wish him well in his new endeavor.''
   Milken widely was credited with creating a $175 billion-a-year
junk bond market. His pitchman sale of the bonds _ previously used
mainly by companies with low credit ratings _ helped fuel the
decade's corporate takeover mania by giving smaller companies and
corporate raiders a tool for financing growth, mergers and takeovers.
   But the federal government alleges Milken used his powers through
Drexel to engage in a range of securities crimes, including schemes
with now-jailed stock speculator Ivan Boesky.
   He also is accused of insider trading in a separate SEC lawsuit.
No settlement has been reached and no trial scheduled in that case.
   Milken had been on leave from Drexel since his criminal
indictment. His brother, Lowell, who also was charged in the case,
announced Thursday he was quitting the firm to return to practicing
law.
   ``I am naturally disappointed to be forced to leave Drexel as
part of the firm's settlement with the government, but I look
forward to the opportunity of helping people build companies,''
Michael Milken said in a statement.
   Milken joined Drexel full-time in 1970 after graduating from the
University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. In 1978, he moved
Drexel's junk bond division to Beverly Hills.
   Milken's trial in federal court in Manhattan is set for next
March. He is free under a $700 million bond package.
   Lawyers close to the case indicated Milken's decision to resign
was calculated. By quitting, Milken pre-empts the firm's agreement
with the SEC to dismiss him once the settlement is approved by a
federal judge.
   With Milken's resignation, lawyers may argue that parts of the
Drexel pact are moot and mount further challenges. They also are
expected to challenge the provision barring Drexel and Milken from
doing business with the same clients.
