   Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association has filed a
$6 billion civil lawsuit accusing Michael Milken and other former
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. officials of fraudulently peddling junk
bonds in the 1980s.
   The lawsuit, filed Wednesday by the failing savings and loan,
claims that Milken and others manipulated and coerced Columbia and
other thrifts into buying billions of dollars worth of the risky
high-yield bonds.
   ``Absent such deceit and manipulations it would have been clear
that the market for junk bonds was highly illiquid and that junk
bonds were unsuitable investments for savings and loan
institutions,'' the suit says.
   Columbia once was a major Drexel customer. It holds a junk bond
portfolio with a face value of over $4 billion, the largest of any
thrift. Milken had a close business relationship with former
Columbia chairman Thomas Spiegel, who resigned last year.
   Milken, the former head of Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif.-based
junk bond department, was sentenced last month to 10 years in
prison for six felonies related to illegal trading practices. None
of the charges involved junk bonds.
   The lawsuit by Columbia, filed in U.S. District Court in Los
Angeles, names Milken, nine other Drexel officials and more than
100 investment partnerships sponsored by the collapsed Wall Street
firm.
   It alleges that the thrift lost more than $2 billion on
investments in junk bonds and seeks three times that amount under
federal racketeering and antitrust laws.
   Columbia, based in Beverly Hills, said in the lawsuit that
Milken and other Drexel officials manipulated, coerced and deceived
the thrift by promising that the market for the bonds would remain
active and the thrift would make money.
   In a statement, a spokesman for Milken said the lawsuit was
without merit. The statement said Columbia was an independent
institution that made its own investment decisions, often in
disagreement with Milken.
   ``It is outrageous now to blame Michael Milken for losses as a
result of strategies and decisions that were implemented long after
he was no longer active at Drexel Burnham Lambert, and which he did
not endorse or agree with,'' the statement said.
   Milken resigned from Drexel last year but the statement said he
had gradually reduced his day-to-day activity after he was linked
to the government's Wall Street investigation in late 1986.
   It said the lawsuit amounts to ``shifting the blame to the most
convenient scapegoat on the financial scene - Michael Milken - who
has been blamed for every problem facing the U.S. economy except
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.''
   The lawsuit joins scores of other civil complaints against
Milken for alleged wrongdoing related to his guilty plea as well as
other trading activity during his tenure at Drexel, which is now in
federal bankruptcy court proceedings.
   The 176-page lawsuit by Columbia also claims that Milken and
other Drexel employees appropriated stock in buyouts for themselves
via the investment partnerships that should have gone to junk bond
buyers in the deals.
   The suit accuses Milken and others of manipulating the junk bond
market, giving bribes and stock investment opportunities to some
thrift executives, misappropriating valuable stock interests in
junk bond deals, skimming profits from junk bond trading, and
controlling through illegal means a web of thrifts and other
investors in junk bonds.
   Columbia was one of many savings and loans, big investors and
other institutions that invested heavily in deals financed or
supported by Drexel in the 1980s.
   Columbia says in the suit that its junk bonds have a total face
value of $4.3 billion, but that it has written down their value to
$2.5 billion to account for the decline in their market price. It
also says it has suffered actual losses of $200 million through the
sale of some bonds.
   The suit says Columbia was ``ill-equipped'' to make use of
relaxed federal laws in the early 1980s that allowed thrifts to
invest in corporate securities such as junk bonds. It alleges that
Milken and the others exploited this weakness.
   The savings and loan is expected to be take over soon by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. as part of the nation's costly
thrift bailout.
   The FDIC and Resolution Trust Corp., which administers the
failed thrifts, already have filed a claim for $4.5 billion against
Drexel in federal bankruptcy court alleging that fraudulent junk
bond dealings caused Columbia heavy losses.
   Also named in the Milken lawsuit are former Drexel chief
executive Frederick Joseph; Milken's brother, Lowell, also a former
Drexel executive; Peter Ackerman, Drexel's former chief of capital
markets; and other officials.
   As part of his settlement of criminal and civil charges by the
government, Milken has agreed to place $400 million in a fund to
compensate investors harmed by his actions. But he would remain
liable for awards exceeding the amount in the fund.
