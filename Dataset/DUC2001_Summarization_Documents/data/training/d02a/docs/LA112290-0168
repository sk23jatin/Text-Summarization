Despite what you may be reading, Michael Milken is not a bloodless monster who 
set out to pillage the world and drown it in a sea of debt. He's a very smart, 
very driven and very flawed human being whose life -- and whose life's work -- 
has been completely destroyed. Anyone who doesn't feel at least a tinge of 
compassion for the man doesn't have an ounce of compassion in his body. 
</P>
<P>
Milken isn't a symbol of the 1980s, whatever that means. He's just a guy who 
was in the right place at the right time -- he started dealing in junk bonds 
when bargains were lying around like truffles on the forest floor -- who took a 
good idea much too far. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was that the rewards of owning junk bonds more than outweighed the 
risks of the borrowers going belly up. Milken took it too far by insisting that 
junk bonds -- securities that carry high risks and high interest rates -- were 
suitable for everyone. Which, in fact, they aren't, as the current crash in the 
junk market -- or in what remains of the junk market -- shows. 
</P>
<P>
Milken was obsessed with getting more and more people to accept the Gospel of 
Junk, and he almost single-handedly turned junk from a backwater of finance 
into a mainstream investment. Making junk mainstream is what did Milken in -- 
and ultimately what did in the junk bond market. 
</P>
<P>
When the junk market was small and had few players, people had no one to deal 
with but Milken, and he could keep weak borrowers out of the market. Once other 
brokerage houses decided to go after the junk business, Milken's competitive 
juices -- and his obsession with controlling every aspect of everything in his 
life -- compelled him to do whatever sleazy things it took to nail down 
business. 
</P>
<P>
If junk had stayed a backwater -- and if either the enforcers at the Securities 
and Exchange Commission or Milken's alleged superiors at Drexel Burnham Lambert 
reined Milken in -- he wouldn't be going to jail. 
</P>
<P>
But the SEC didn't go after Milken until a trail of stool pigeons fingered Ivan 
F. Boesky, who fingered Milken. And instead of supervising Milken, top Drexel 
officials averted their eyes to avoid seeing his sin. In fact, Drexel let 
Milken move the entire junk department from New York City to his native 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Milken's department was making so much money that Drexel Chairman Frederick H. 
Joseph let Milken do whatever he wanted because Joseph needed the 
Milken-generated profits to turn Drexel into a mainline brokerage house. 
</P>
<P>
To understand Milken, you have to understand that when he wandered into the 
world of junk bonds at a third-rate Philadelphia brokerage house in the 1970s, 
the junk market consisted of a handful of canny investors who spent their days 
searching through the rubble of financially distressed companies searching for 
securities that were better than they looked. 
</P>
<P>
Because Milken is very smart, has a good head for numbers and could work 
incredible hours, he found more of these little jewels than anyone else did. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, he persuaded his bosses to give him enough money to keep an inventory of 
junk around. This meant that when early "junkmeisters" -- Saul P. Steinberg of 
Reliance Insurance, Laurence A. Tisch of Loews, Carl Lindner of Penn Central 
and American Financial, to name a few -- wanted to buy or sell junk, they had 
to deal with Milken. 
</P>
<P>
But as the market for junk grew larger -- mainly because of what Michael was 
doing -- Milken wanted to keep all the business. To do that, he financed deals 
that he knew he should never have touched, and he went so far as to offer 
secret goodies to people who had money to invest in junk. That way, he bound 
these people to him. 
</P>
<P>
When the market was small, no one knew or cared what Milken was doing. When it 
got big -- and when he began raising money for a band of corporate brigands to 
take over mainline U.S. companies like Gulf Oil and Union Carbide -- that was a 
different game. He was used to operating without anyone knowing what he was 
doing, and he didn't understand that the rules had changed, and he had to clean 
up his act. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, being a complicated guy, has conflicting tendencies. On the one hand, 
he lives very modestly and always talks about how important it is not to take 
on airs. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he felt himself smarter than anybody, and thought he could 
indefinitely get away with sleazy things. Such as telling bond issuers that 
bond buyers wanted cheap stock as a "sweetener," then keeping the stock for 
himself and a handful of associates. 
</P>
<P>
During 1987, 1988 and 1989, I spent many hours with Milken, whom I came to 
consider a friend. He was brilliant, but he had no sense of humor and no sense 
of how other people perceived him. He didn't blame himself for his problems, he 
blamed the news media. And probably still does. 
</P>
<P>
Milken has lost almost everything that he holds dear. He used to pride himself 
on being a quiet donor of huge amounts to charity and of working, unheralded, 
with disadvantaged children. But he decided to let his public relations people 
turn charity into a PR show. 
</P>
<P>
He used to pride himself on having established the junk bond market. But that 
market is gone, and many of his most important junk clients -- Columbia Savings 
&amp; Loan of Beverly Hills, First Executive Corp. of Los Angeles -- are busto, 
and many others, such as Lindner and Steinberg -- seem to be in big trouble. 
</P>
<P>
He prided himself on his staff's loyalty to him -- but many of them turned 
state's evidence. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Milken broke down and cried several times Wednesday, it was far too 
late for him to be considered a human being. He was sentenced as the Beast of 
the '80s, but he will suffer as a man. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Milken still has a vast fortune. But his life and work are in ruins, and 
he will spend who knows how many years in the slammer while his kids grow up 
and leave home. Even though he brought it on himself, watching how this man has 
destroyed himself is enough to make me want to cry.
