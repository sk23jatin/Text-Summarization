   Michael Milken, who faces insider
trading charges, is seen as the Wall Street whiz kid who made
``junk-bond'' financing into the tool of choice for corporate
raiders.
   In so doing, Milken, 42, transformed Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
from a minor player on Wall Street into a powerhouse and in the
process made himself feared, respected and enormously wealthy.
   The 184-page civil complaint filed in U.S. District Court in New
York against Milken, Drexel and others on Wednesday followed months
of speculation about Drexel's involvement in the Ivan Boesky
insider trading scandal.
   Although the move by the Securities and Exchange Commission had
been anticipated, Milken and others who have made fortunes in junk
bonds continued to hold their annual Beverly Hills spring gathering
known as the Predators' Ball. The message was clear: Never mind the
burgeoning government investigation of insider trading. It was
business as usual at Drexel, and Milken was still king of the junk
bonds _ high-risk, high-yield notes used to finance corporate
takeovers.
   Milken had refused to comment publicly on the scandal up until
Wednesday, when he issued a written statement asserting that ``for
the past 22 months I have been the subject of a shadow trial of
systematic leaks and innuendo based on false accusations.''
   In anticipation of a crisis, Drexel undertook a public-relations
campaign starting last year to polish its image, stressing the role
of junk bonds in helping small companies and downplaying their role
in large takeover battles.
   The normally secretive and unreachable Milken himself played a
major role in that blitz, accepting speaking engagements. He
granted selective media interviews _ on condition there would be no
questions about the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
investigation.
   The speeches and interviews focused almost solely on Milken's
latest pet plan _ to alleviate the Latin American debt crisis by
swapping debt for equity or selling securities backed by those
countries' oil and silver resources.
   In the years before the insider trading scandal, the financial
media wrote glowingly of Milken.
   ``A one-man revolution,'' Forbes magazine headlined one typical
article.
   ``A world-class financial wizard, on a plane with the likes of
Bernard Baruch and Jay Gould ... Mozart of the money markets,''
wrote California Business magazine.
   It had been a relatively short road for Milken, from head
cheerleader at Birmingham High School in the San Fernando Valley in
1964 _ actress Sally Field and superagent Michael Ovitz were among
his classmates _ to the top of the nation's financial industry.
   Milken reportedly pulls down $40 million a year as the head of
Drexel's junk-bond operation and his personal fortune has been
estimated at more than $500 million.
   He lives with his children and wife, Lori _ his high school
sweetheart whom he married at age 22 _ in a house on the former
estate of the late actor Clark Gable in suburban Encino, an
upper-middle-class section of the San Fernando Valley two miles
from his childhood home.
   Milken's fascination with finance stetches back to his boyhood.
   At age 10, while other boys were giggling over comic books,
Michael Robert Milken was enamored of money. A favorite pastime was
hovering over tax returns being prepared by his father, an
accountant.
   After studying business at the University of California,
Berkeley, and the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School,
Milken went to work for Drexel Firestone &amp; Co. in Philadelphia as a
junior bond trader.
   Drexel merged with Burnham &amp; Co. in 1973 and Lambert Brussels
Witter in 1976 to become today's Drexel Burnham Lambert, and
Milken's job was moved to New York.
   Milken worked hard to make a name for himself but never got used
to the East. As the story goes, he wearied of the cold Eastern
winters that froze his water pipes and kept his two children from
playing outside. He also tired of the long commutes from his home
in suburban Philadelphia to Wall Street.
   In 1977, he pulled off a coup by convincing Drexel to let him
move the company's junk-bond operations from Wall Street to Beverly
Hills, just off swank Rodeo Drive.
   His reasoning was simple: He didn't have to be sitting in a tiny
office in Manhattan to make deals. He just had to know the players
and have their confidence.
   Milken was enormously successful in that regard, almost
single-handedly building a close-knit network of junk-bond
investors. Milken no longer has to go on the road to make deals.
The corporate players come to him.
   Milken still works hard _ 12 to 13 hours a day, seven days a
week. He once said he had no hobbies ``because what I do is fun.''
   Milken's appearance generally is described as ordinary. He buys
his suits off the rack, and it was only a couple years ago that he
traded in his unstylish American car for a Mercedes.
