<P>
A federal judge sentenced an apparently stunned Michael Milken to 10 years in 
prison Wednesday after ruling that the crimes he pleaded guilty to were neither 
minor nor isolated. 
</P>
<P>
The sentence was by far the harshest imposed in the recent chain of Wall Street 
scandals. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood said the unexpectedly long prison term is 
meant to make an example of the former Drexel Burnham Lambert junk bond king, 
whose innovative use of high-yield, high-risk bonds had fueled the corporate 
takeover frenzy of the 1980s. Milken had pleaded guilty to six felony 
securities law violations last April. 
</P>
<P>
But in a jammed courtroom in Manhattan's federal courthouse, Wood said that 
Milken, 44, who has been accused, among other things, of helping to bring on 
the national savings and loan disaster, could not be blamed for all of the 
financial excesses of the 1980s. Wood said she had not made him a scapegoat for 
"the decade of greed." The judge said she based the sentence only on evidence 
of specific crimes presented in court. 
</P>
<P>
Milken family members, supporters and lawyers were plainly shocked by the 
sentence. One close Milken adviser said: "No one could have imagined this in 
their wildest nightmare." Defense lawyer Arthur L. Liman left the courthouse 
without commenting and did not return phone calls later. 
</P>
<P>
Milken's sentence also included three years' probation during which he must 
perform full-time community service. The judge left open the possibility of 
reducing the sentence if Milken cooperates with the government. 
</P>
<P>
Milken could have been sentenced to as many as 28 years. But a number of 
lawyers who had followed the case closely predicted that he would get no more 
than five. A Milken spokesman said that no decision had been made on whether to 
appeal the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
During his own lawyer's presentation before sentence was imposed, Milken at 
times was in tears in the courtroom. He then stood and, choking back sobs, 
said: "What I did violated not just the law but all of my own principles and 
values. I deeply regret it and will for the rest of my life, and I am very 
deeply sorry." 
</P>
<P>
But when the judge read the sentence, he stood rigid and motionless, with what 
appeared to be a look of disbelief when she announced the 10-year term. Wood 
also sentenced him to three years of community service while on probation after 
his prison sentence. Milken and his wife, Lori, did not comment to reporters 
and were permitted to leave the courthouse through a back exit. 
</P>
<P>
Under his plea agreement, Milken was already committed to pay $600 million in 
fines and penalties. Lawyers said he must turn over that amount before the end 
of the year. Because of his huge earnings at Drexel, however, his wealth is 
expected to be at least hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Wood said evidence presented during a pre-sentencing hearing in October 
convinced her that Milken had committed additional serious crimes beyond the 
six felony counts he pleaded guilty to in April. Among them, she said, were 
several acts of obstruction of justice relating to orders or suggestions to 
employees to destroy documents. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also rejected longstanding defense claims that Milken's crimes were 
aberrations by a generally law-abiding man and that they were the result of 
overzealousness to help clients rather than greed. 
</P>
<P>
Wood called Milken "a man of talent and industry." But she said: "This kind of 
misuse of your leadership position and enlisting employees who you supervised 
to assist you in violating the law are serious crimes warranting serious 
punishment and the discomfort and opprobrium of being removed from society." 
</P>
<P>
At Liman's request, the judge agreed to sentence Milken under a provision of 
federal law that allows him to be paroled at any time at the discretion of the 
federal parole commission. Although Milken technically could be paroled almost 
immediately, government lawyers said the commission normally requires prisoners 
to serve close to two-thirds of their sentence. In Milken's case, that would be 
about six years. 
</P>
<P>
The sentence exceeds all others imposed in the series of securities fraud cases 
that grew out of the insider trading case against investment banker Dennis B. 
Levine in 1986. Levine himself got two years. Stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky, 
implicated in insider trading on an even grander scale, got only three years. 
Investment banker Martin A. Siegel, who directly stole information from his own 
corporate clients and also received suitcases stuffed with cash from Boesky, 
was let off with only two months. 
</P>
<P>
But in those cases, the defendants had fully cooperated with the government 
before their sentencing, turning in prominent former business associates. 
Milken had not. Under the highly unusual terms of his plea agreement, he is 
obliged to begin cooperating only now that the sentence has been imposed. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said she would consider reducing the sentence if prosecutors 
eventually certify to her that Milken has cooperated fully. 
</P>
<P>
Several lawyers said they interpreted the long sentence as an attempt by the 
judge to ensure that Milken cooperates fully, revealing whatever incriminating 
information he knows about corporate raiders, junk bond buyers and former 
co-workers. Charles Carberry, a lawyer who once headed the U.S. attorney's 
securities fraud unit in New York, said: "I think it was a clear message that 
he should cooperate." 
</P>
<P>
John C. Coffee, a Columbia University law professor, said the judge may also 
have imposed the severe sentence because Milken occupied a position of trust at 
the center of the financial world. "There's a long tradition here of viewing 
very seriously abuses by people with high responsibilities, and this man was at 
the crossroads of capitalism," Coffee said. 
</P>
<P>
The six counts that Milken pleaded guilty to included conspiracy, securities 
fraud, causing the filing of false information with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, mail fraud and aiding in the filing of a false tax return. 
</P>
<P>
The sentencing capped the most massive securities fraud investigation ever 
carried out by the government. Milken, who joined Drexel while still in 
business school in 1969, plucked junk bonds from obscurity and almost 
single-handedly built what at its peak became a $200-billion market. From 
Drexel's junk bond headquarters in Beverly Hills, Milken orchestrated 
transactions that made possible huge leveraged buyouts of such companies as 
Storer Communications and Beatrice Cos. 
</P>
<P>
But as investigators closed in, Milken was forced to resign from Drexel in 
1989, after he was named in a 99-count racketeering indictment and the firm 
itself pleaded guilty to six felony counts. Months later, the junk bond market 
started to collapse. And in February, Drexel was forced into bankruptcy 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Milken's pay at Drexel peaked in 1987 at $550 million. In addition to total 
compensation of more than $1 billion from 1984 to 1988, Milken is believed to 
have received hundreds of millions of dollars from private partnerships he set 
up to benefit himself, family members and employees. 
</P>
<P>
Milken's lawyers, however, said that Milken's lifestyle was relatively modest 
and unmaterialistic. They noted that he had given much of his earnings to 
charities and that he long had personally worked for them, such as by teaching 
math to abused and abandoned inner-city children. 
</P>
<P>
Liman called Milken "a sensitive human being with a social conscience whose 
offenses stand in sharp contrast to his whole life and to his value system." 
Liman also argued that Milken is "just not cut from the same cloth as Ivan 
Boesky." 
</P>
<P>
The judge did not dispute that Milken had donated much to worthy causes, nor 
that his charitable activities began well before the investigation of him 
started in 1986. But she said that was not enough to make up for his crimes. 
</P>
<P>
During the sentencing, Wood disclosed for the first time her findings on the 
unusual pre-sentencing hearings she presided over in October. The so-called 
Fatico hearings were held to determine if there were evidence of additional 
crimes beyond the six to which he pleaded guilty. Under federal court rulings, 
Wood is allowed to consider evidence of other crimes in deciding on a sentence. 
</P>
<P>
In a lengthy written opinion released Wednesday, Wood found that Assistant U.S. 
Attorneys John Carroll and Jess Fardella had failed to prove some of their main 
claims. She said there was insufficient evidence to prove that Milken was 
behind a manipulation of WickesCos. stock in 1986. She said the government also 
did not prove its claim that Milken was guilty of insider trading in Caesars 
World securities in 1983, and also failed to show that he had illegally made 
lucrative investment opportunities available to employees of investment funds 
as inducements to get them to buy riskier securities for their funds. 
</P>
<P>
But she found that Milken had obstructed justice, in part, by arranging the 
destruction of a blue ledger book that showed illegal transactions between 
Drexel and David Solomon, head of Solomon Asset Management. The judge said 
Milken also had made remarks to employees in the Beverly Hills office in 
November, 1986, which could only be interpreted as instructions to destroy 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
Wood also found that Milken had acted improperly by not disclosing to the 
leveraged buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. that he had kept 
extremely valuable warrants in a KKR deal for himself and his family instead of 
selling them to customers. 
</P>
<P>
During the sentencing, Wood derided defense claims that Milken was basically 
law-abiding and that if he were not, he would have committed more blatant 
crimes, such as insider trading. She said that an equally likely explanation 
was that Milken was simply afraid to do anything too blatant. 
</P>
<P>
"Your crimes show a pattern of skirting the law, stepping just over to the 
wrong side of the law in an apparent effort to get some of the benefits from 
violating the law without running a substantial risk of being caught," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Wood's sentence was viewed as a rebuff to many prominent Southern Californians 
who had written to her urging that Milken's sentence be limited to community 
service. Among those who had proposed that Milken was suitable for such service 
was Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, who suggested that Milken work for 
the Police Department's DARE program, created to help inner-city children. In 
court, Liman had proposed that the judge accept Gates' suggestion. The chief, 
through a spokesman, declined to comment on the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
James Slade, a spokesman for the federal Bureau of Prisons, said that under 
Justice Department rules, the 10-year term makes it unlikely that Milken will 
be allowed to serve his sentence in a minimum-security federal prison camp. 
Such camps, where Boesky and others caught up in the Wall Street scandals 
served their sentences, have open rooms instead of cells and offer extensive 
recreation facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Slade said, Milken probably will be sent to a medium-security prison, 
where there will be a higher concentration of street criminals and fewer 
white-collar offenders. He said that in some medium-security prisons, inmates 
are locked in old-fashioned barred cells at night.
