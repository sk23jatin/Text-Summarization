"Junk bond" wizard Michael Milken officially ended his 20-year career at Drexel 
Burnham Lambert Inc. on Thursday and said he will launch his own financial 
consulting firm while he awaits trial on racketeering and securities fraud 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, 42, who has been on a leave of absence from Drexel since March 29, on 
Thursday submitted his resignation. In a telephone interview, he said his new 
firm, International Capital Access Group, would offer a wide range of 
consulting services consistent with his personal interests and his previous 
work at Drexel. He claimed that one purpose of the firm will be to "address the 
major issues in society." 
</P>
<P>
He said he would offer advice on subjects as diverse as the Third World debt 
crisis, helping unions, employees and minorities obtain ownership stakes in 
companies and advising financially troubled companies on how to raise new 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Emotional Experience' 
</P>
<P>
The timing of Milken's resignation appears to have been influenced by a Supreme 
Court decision last week that cleared the way for Drexel to complete its 
announced plan to settle civil insider-trading and securities fraud charges 
brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The settlement now is 
expected to go into effect within the next few weeks. It requires Drexel to 
terminate Milken's employment and also avoid any direct or indirect business 
dealings with him. 
</P>
<P>
Milken's brother, Lowell Milken, 39, also resigned Thursday from Drexel. He 
said through his attorney that he plans to resume practicing law. Lowell Milken 
had been a lawyer with the Los Angeles firm of Irell &amp; Manella before he 
left in 1978 to help his brother run Drexel's junk bond department. Michael 
Armstrong, Lowell Milken's lawyer, said his client hasn't decided yet where he 
will practice. Lowell Milken was also indicted in March on racketeering 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
During the rare, on-the-record interview, Michael Milken said of the 
resignation: "After spending your whole life working for one company, it's a 
very emotional experience." But in a reference to the investigation and legal 
problems that have beset him, he added, "the last few years have been an 
emotional experience." 
</P>
<P>
Milken said he decided to set up his own firm now because "to continue to help 
(people he has done business with or offered advice to), I need some vehicle to 
be able to help." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Naturally Disappointed' 
</P>
<P>
Milken started out in 1969 as a part-time employee at Drexel Harriman, a 
Philadelphia investment firm that was a precursor to Drexel Burnham Lambert, 
while attending the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business. 
Within a decade, his pioneering use of high-yield, high-risk junk bonds had 
transformed Drexel from a second-tier brokerage firm into one of Wall Street's 
most powerful investment banking houses. 
</P>
<P>
In a written statement issued Thursday, Milken said: 
</P>
<P>
"Drexel is the only company I've worked for since graduating from college. And 
it's the only one I ever expected to work for. I am naturally disappointed to 
be forced to leave Drexel as part of the firm's settlement with the government, 
but I look forward to the opportunity of helping people build companies." 
</P>
<P>
Milken currently faces a 98-count federal criminal indictment. The government 
is also demanding that he forfeit $1.85 billion under the racketeering charges. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Anreder, Drexel's spokesman, said: "Michael Milken made many important 
contributions to Drexel Burnham, and his resignation, although not unexpected, 
is a sad event." He added: "We wish him well in his new endeavor." 
</P>
<P>
Milken was somewhat vague about exactly what the new firm will do or how many 
people it will employ. His personal spokesman, Ken Lerer, said it would start 
out with fewer than 10 employees. Tentative plans call for it to be based in 
West Los Angeles, and Lerer said it definitely won't be in the Beverly Hills 
building that houses Drexel's junk bond department. Milken, his brother and 
several other partners own that building. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Declined to Speculate 
</P>
<P>
Milken said he isn't currently talking with any of his former colleagues at 
Drexel about coming to work for his new firm, but he didn't rule out that 
possibility. "I just can't tell you at this time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also declined to speculate on whether he might try to expand the firm to 
offer full-scale investment banking services if he should succeed in overcoming 
the criminal and civil charges facing him. "The financial world changes all the 
time," he said. "Exactly what one would be interested in doing in the future I 
don't know." 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, Milken's legal problems probably will prevent him from 
competing directly with Drexel, individuals involved in the legal cases said. 
Were he to branch out beyond consulting to underwriting or trading securities, 
he might run afoul of federal and state regulators who supervise the 
registration of securities broker-dealers. But sources said the potential 
exists nevertheless for conflicts with Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC settlement's ban on Drexel doing business either directly or indirectly 
with Milken could be interpreted to mean that Drexel can't do business with 
clients advised by Milken. Milken's lawyers haven't said yet whether they will 
challenge that provision of the settlement in court. If it goes into effect, 
however, it conceivably could force clients to choose between dealing with 
Milken or Drexel. A source close to Milken said: "I think you'd have to take it 
on a case-by-case basis." 
</P>
<P>
Anreder said: "We don't anticipate any conflicts." 
</P>
<P>
Milken also declined to say if he might refer clients to firms other than 
Drexel for investment banking services. "I can't predict what's going to happen 
in the future," he said. "We'll see what happens and it will depend on each 
individual situation." 
</P>
<P>
Milken, who earned amounts ranging up to $550 million per year at Drexel, over 
the last year has attempted to help arrange financing for unions and workers 
seeking to take over troubled companies. He also has proposed innovative 
solutions to the Latin American debt problem. Some observers have viewed this 
as part of an overall public relations campaign at a time when he is in 
trouble. But Lerer insists that these are all genuine interests of Milken's and 
that he has been involved in these activities for years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'More Demands Than Ever' 
</P>
<P>
Friends of Milken's have speculated that one reason he decided to start a new 
firm now is that, since taking a leave of absence from Drexel, he has had an 
unaccustomed amount of time on his hands. They note that Milken typically would 
work from 4:30 a.m. until about 6 p.m. He was used to orchestrating a multitude 
of deals at once. In recent weeks, Milken has given speeches to a variety of 
organizations and worked on his legal defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Michael is desperate to find something to do," a former Drexel 
colleague said. 
</P>
<P>
Milken himself, however, strongly denied that he has time on his hands. "I have 
more demands on my time than ever before," he said, although he added, 
referring to the legal cases: "Sometimes they're things you'd rather not have 
to spend time on." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Lynch, the SEC's director of enforcement, declined to comment Thursday on 
Milken's decision to open a new business. The Milken brothers still face SEC 
civil charges as well as the separate criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, his brother and former Drexel trader Bruce L. Newberg are likely to go 
to trial on the pending criminal charges sometime early next year. Federal 
prosecutors are expected to bring a new indictment within the next several 
months containing additional charges. 
</P>
<P>
A number of Milken's former colleagues at Drexel already have been granted 
immunity from prosecution and are cooperating with the government 
investigation. Sources confirmed Thursday that another former Drexel employee, 
Reed Harmon, who had worked closely with Milken, was recently granted immunity 
in exchange for testimony before a grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charges Denied 
</P>
<P>
Harmon is said to have detailed knowledge of some of Milken's business dealings 
with former stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky. Boesky, suspected of widespread 
insider trading, pleaded guilty to one criminal count and agreed to cooperate 
with prosecutors. Much of the government's case against Milken involves his 
alleged dealings with Boesky. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, Lowell Milken and Newberg all vigorously deny the charges against them. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel has agreed to plead guilty to six criminal charges and pay $650 million 
in penalties under an agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan. 
The guilty plea would be made after the firm's separate settlement with the SEC 
goes into effect. Lawyers for Michael and Lowell Milken are challenging 
provisions of the settlement agreement, including a requirement that Drexel 
withhold much of the brothers' compensation owed them for 1988. Michael Milken 
is said to be owed at least $200 million.
