Michael Milken showed an unusual interest in money as early as age ten
as he watched his accountant father preparing tax returns. He
graduated from high school in Van Nuys, California in 1964. After
earning an undergraduate degree in business at the University of
California, Berkeley, he moved to Philadelphia where he attended the
University of Pennsylvania's Wharton Graduate School of Business and
worked part time in the Philadelphia office of a precursor of Drexel
Burnham Lambert.

Moving to Wall Street with Drexel, Milken's shrewd trading in junk
bonds made millions of dollars for the company and for himself. In
1978 he convinced Drexel to let him move its junk bond operations from
New York to Los Angeles. An intense workaholic, Milken typically
worked 15-hour days seven days a week. By 1982 he was making $45
million a year and by the time he turned 42 in 1988 he had become one
of the nation's richest men with a net worth of close to $1 billion.

Milken formed a very profitable working relationship with Ivan
F. Boesky, the two men manipulating the market and using confidential
information to satisfy their greed. This was to prove Milken's
undoing. Tipped off by some of the lesser players in these schemes,
the SEC began investigating Boesky who finally on Sept. 17, 1986,
surrendered to federal authorities and became an undercover agent for
the Department of Justice. In December 1987 Boesky was sentenced to
three years in prison and in September 1988 the SEC accused Drexel,
Milken and others of insider trading, stock manipulation, and
fraud. Drexel settled, pleading guilty to six felonies in
Dec. 1988. In March of 1989 Milken, his brother Lowell, and partner
Bruce Newberg were indicted on 98 counts of federal racketeering,
insider trading and other securities fraud. The indictment asked that
the three accused forfeit $1.85 billion earned in a continuing
criminal enterprise operated at Drexel.

Milken resigned from Drexel on June 15, 1989. In April 1990 he pleaded
guilty to six felony counts, agreed to pay $600 million and awaited
sentencing, apparently expecting, at the worst, a two year prison
sentence. On November 21, 1990 a federal judge sentenced Milken to ten
years in prison and three years on probation with full-time community
service. Milken appeared stunned. His sentencing was followed by
filing of civil suits for billions of dollars on behalf of his
victims.  </SUM>
