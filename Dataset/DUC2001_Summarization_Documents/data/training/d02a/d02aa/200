Michael Milken made a name for himself as a shrewd dealer in junk
bonds With Drexel Burnham Lambert. In 1978 he convinced Drexel to let
him move its junk bond operations from New York to Los
Angeles. Working 15-hour days seven days a week, Milken built a
network of trading partners who made immense profits from trading
risky securities.

By 1982 Milken was making $45 million a year and by the time he turned
42 in 1988 his net worth was close to $1 billion. The SEC became
suspicious of the activities of one of Milken's principal traders,
Ivan F. Boesky, and feeling them in hot pursuit, Boesky surrendered to
federal authorities in Sept. 1986 and became an undercover agent for
the Department of Justice. In Sept. 1988 the SEC accused Drexel,
Milken and others of insider trading, stock manipulation, and
fraud. Drexel settled, pleading guilty to six felonies in
Dec. 1988. Milken held out, but in March 1989 he, his brother, and a
partner were indicted on 98 counts of securities fraud. In April 1990
Milken pleaded guilty to six felony counts and agreed to pay $600
million in damages with sentencing to follow. He was shocked on
November 21, 1990 when a federal judge sentenced him to ten years in
prison.  </SUM>
