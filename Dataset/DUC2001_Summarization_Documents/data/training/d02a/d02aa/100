As head of Drexel Burnham Lambert's Los Angeles junk bond operations
Michael Milken made a fortune for himself and raised Drexel from the
second tier of brokerages to one of the most powerful investment firms
on Wall Street. By the time he turned 42, Milken's net worth was close
to $1 billion. The following year, however, he and his brother and a
partner were indicted on 98 counts of securities fraud. Milken
eventually pleaded guilty to six felony counts and agreed to pay $600
million in damages with sentencing to follow.  On November 21, 1990 a
federal judge sentenced him to ten years in prison.  </SUM>
