   President Bush today renewed his threat to
veto legislation raising the minimum wage beyond $4.25 an hour as
Senate Democrats moved to quickly pass a bill raising the wage
floor to $4.55.
   House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., who met with Bush and
relayed his comments to reporters, said the president ``made it
abundantly clear there will be absolutely no flexibility, not one
penny, not one deviation'' from his position on the minimum wage.
   Bush met with Republican congressional leaders hours before the
Senate opened debate on the legislation.
   The Senate bill, sponsored by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
would raise the hourly minimum from $3.35 to $4.65 by January 1992
and contains no provision allowing a lower wage for new workers.
   But Kennedy aides said he would offer an amendment making his
measure identical to the House bill passed two weeks ago, which has
a final wage of $4.55 and would allow employers to pay new entrants
in the job market a ``sub-minimum'' for two months.
   Bush has insisted that employers be allowed to pay any new
employees a sub-minimum ``training wage'' for six months. The GOP
leaders who met with Bush said he also reiterated his opposition to
shortening that time frame.
   Another of the Republicans with whom Bush met, Sen. Thad
Cochran, R-Miss., told reporters afterward that ``the message that
was given to the president by the Senate (GOP) leadership was that
we're going to stand with him on the minimum wage issue. And we
urged him not to back down from his commitment to $4.25 and the
six-month training wage.''
   Republicans could thwart the Democrats' quick-passage strategy
by staging a filibuster, but an aide to one leading GOP senator
said there were no plans to do that. The aide said it appeared the
Democrats had the votes to win passage of their plan by early next
week.
   Meanwhile, a new poll said there was overwhelming public support
for an increase in the minimum wage, which has been at $3.35 since
1981.
   The Washington Post@ABC News survey, conducted March 30 through
April 3, said 84 percent of respondents backed an increase while 14
percent did not. Eighty-two percent said they favored an increase
even if it would trigger higher consumer prices.
   But only about half of the 84 percent who initially favored a
higher minimum wage said they would hold to that opinion even if it
meant businesses would stop hiring, or would fire, workers because
of added payroll costs caused by a higher minimum wage. The poll
had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
   By agreeing to amend his bill, Kennedy, provided the amended
version wins passage, averts the need for a conference committee to
resolve differences between the House and Senate versions.
   A number of other amendments were also expected, including a GOP
attempt to substitute Bush's proposal.
   A lobbyist in favor of raising the minimum wage said Bush's
repeated veto threats had all but quashed any hopes by Democratic
sponsors of avoiding a showdown with the president.
   ``He says he won't compromise so I don't see a need for us to do
anything except send him our bill,'' said AFL-CIO lobbyist Robert
McGlotten.
   Bush has been adamant in saying he would veto the House-passed
bill and appears to have the votes to sustain a veto in both
chambers of Congress.
   While the House-passed bill cuts the final target of the hourly
minimum wage to $4.55, it moves up the effective dates of the three
increases from Jan. 1 to Oct. 1 _ meaning the first increase would
come this year and the last jump would occur Oct. 1, 1992.
   Bush has proposed three 30-cent increases in the minimum wage
beginning Jan. 1, 1990, and ending two years later with the hourly
minimum at $4.25.
   The president said his support for those increases hinges on a
provision allowing employers to pay new workers a sub-minimum wage
for six months regardless of any past experience with another
employer. The sub-minimum, under the Bush plan, would be $3.35 an
hour after the first increase in the minimum wage. It would rise to
$3.40 an hour by 1992.
   The House-passed bill sets the wage for new hires _ provided it
is their first job _ at $3.35 effective Oct. 1. When the subsequent
increases in the minimum wage took effect the sub-minimum would
rise as well, to 85 percent of the minimum. The provision allowing
the new-hire wage would expire on Sept. 30, 1992.
