   House passage of a plan to raise the minimum
wage shifts the partisan battle to the Senate, where the leading
proponent of an increase is urging President Bush to refrain from
further veto threats while Congress settles on a final bill.
   The House voted 248-171 Thursday in favor of legislation that
would raise the minimum wage from the current $3.35 an hour to $4.55
by October 1991, with the first increase taking effect later this
year.
   The House then joined the Senate on an Easter recess that ends
April 3.
   High on the Senate agenda when it returns is a bill sponsored by
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., that would raise the minimum wage
to $4.65 by 1992.
   Kennedy has said he is open to amending his bill, and in a
statement issued after the House vote he asked Bush, who has
threatened to veto any attempt to raise the hourly minimum above
$4.25, to keep an open mind until the House and Senate agree on a
bill.
   ``This is an excellent opportunity for Congress and the
administration to demonstrate that they can work together and in
doing so achieve a fair increase in the minimum wage and an honest
training wage,'' Kennedy said.
   Bush has insisted that a six-month sub-minimum training wage
covering all newly hired employees be created in any legislation to
raise the minimum wage, a provision he said will help offset
potential job losses caused by raising the minimum.
   Sponsors of the House bill, while disputing GOP projections of
massive job losses, added a provision allowing a sub-minimum wage to
be paid to new hires for two months provided it was their first job.
   That falls far short of the White House demand and, with Kennedy
also opposed to Bush's training-wage proposal, that issue likely
will be a major sticking point in any attempts to reach a compromise.
   Several Republicans insisted that Democrats were going to have to
give in to Bush _ who appears to have the votes to sustain a veto _
or let a ninth year pass without any change in the minimum wage.
   ``The question is do you want a bill or do you want a political
issue?'' Rep. Steve Gunderson, R-Wis., said during an unsuccessful
GOP effort to substitute Bush's proposal for the House leadership's
measure. ``If you truly want to raise the minimum wage this is the
only game in town.''
   But Democrats argued they had given enough by cutting the final
increase from $4.65 an hour to $4.55 and by adding the new-hire wage.
   As amended, the House bill would boost the minimum wage to $3.85
an hour on Oct. 1, to $4.25 on Oct. 1, 1990, and to $4.55 a year
later. The provision for the new-hire wage, to be pegged at 85
percent of the minimum wage, would expire Sept. 30, 1992.
   It also would expand exemptions allowing small businesses to pay
wages lower than the minimum wage and would allow employers of
workers who earn tips to pay them 50 percent of the minimum wage,
down from the current 60 percent.
   Current law exempts service businesses with annual sales of less
than $362,000 from the minimum-wage law; the House bill increased
that level to $500,000. The provision is rarely used, however,
because of confusing regulations lawmakers say will be simplified in
conference committee if the Senate passes a minimum-wage bill.
