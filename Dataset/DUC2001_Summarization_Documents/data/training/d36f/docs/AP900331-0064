<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are key provisions of the legislation
Congress passed last year to increase the minimum wage to $4.25 an
hour and establish a subminimum training wage for certain teen-age
workers. The measure takes effect Sunday.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE RATE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The minimum wage, $3.35 an hour since January 1981, increases to
$3.80 an hour on Sunday and to $4.25 an hour on April 1, 1991. An
estimated 4 million Americans work for the minimum wage.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TRAINING WAGE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Workers ages 16 to 19 may be paid a subminimum training wage for
their first three months in the work force and for an additional 90
days if the employer has a formal training program. The training
wage will be $3.35 an hour when the minimum wage rises to $3.80 an
hour and $3.62 an hour when the minimum wage reaches $4.25 next
April. Migrant seasonal farmworkers are exempt from the subminimum
and the entire subminimum provision expires in April 1993.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WAGE-POVERTY LEVEL</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   After the increase, full-time minimum wage workers would still
find themselves $516 a year short of what it takes to support one
adult and one child at the poverty level, according to government
figures. Minimum wage workers would be $4,796 below the basic needs
level for a family of four.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TIP CREDIT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The wage employers are required to pay workers who receive tips
will increase from 40 percent of the minimum wage to 45 percent of
the minimum wage on April 1. The law requires that tips plus wages
must equal the minimum hourly wage. The percentage goes to 50
percent a year from now.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SMALL BUSINESS EXEMPTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The level at which small businesses are exempt from the federal
minimum wage increases from $362,500 in gross annual sales to
$500,000.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>OTHER EXEMPTIONS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of special exemptions exist, such as for some farm
workers, including tobacco leaf harvesters, casual babysitters,
newspaper delivery workers, amusement park employees, wreath
makers, employees at small radio stations in cities with fewer than
25,000 residents and mollusk and crustacean harvesters.
