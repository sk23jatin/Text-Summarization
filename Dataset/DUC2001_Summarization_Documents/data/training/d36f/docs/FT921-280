A MINIMUM wage is a convenient and effortless way for a left-of-centre
government to appear to be doing something about the problems of poverty,
public sector pay and the growth of unskilled employment. It is also largely
ineffective at solving any of them. But Labour's proposed minimum wage would
only be positively harmful if, as the Tories claim, it will reduce
employment. The recent international evidence is surprisingly mixed.
There are many estimates of the potential employment cost of Labour's
minimum wage. Most of them are based on model simulations of the UK economy.
All of them are, at best, semi-educated guesses; and probably not worth the
effort. No-one knows whether, or how, introducing a statutory minimum wage
would affect unskilled wages and employment.
International evidence is a better source of clues on the likely effects of
a UK minimum wage. The US, in particular, also has a large and highly
competitive service sector employing many women and young people at
relatively low wages. The federal government has increased the statutory
minimum wage twice in the past two years, most recently in April 1991.
Most US studies of the effects of the minimum wage over the past few decades
have found a moderately negative impact on employment, mainly among young
people. A recent study of the effect of extending the mainland minimum wage
to Puerto Rico in 1974 found a more dramatic employment effect. By 1980 the
federal minimum wage was 75 per cent of the average wage in Puerto Rico's
manufacturing industry compared to 43 per cent on the mainland. Its
unemployment rate rose from 11.3 per cent to 23.4 per cent between 1974 and
1983, of which over one third is estimated to be a direct result of the rise
in the minimum wage.
Yet a number of recent empirical studies of the effect of last year's rise
in the US minimum wage fail to support this traditional view. One of the
most careful, directed by Mr Lawrence Katz and Mr Alan Krueger of Harvard
and Princeton Universities, surveyed the wage and employment practices of
314 Burger King, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants in Texas in
August 1991. A third of them had also been surveyed the previous December,
before the higher federal minimum wage came into effect in April. Over half
of the restaurants had to raise the lowest wage they paid by the full 45
cent increase in the minimum wage. Only 5 per cent of restaurants were
already paying more than the new minimum.
The survey directly contradicts the conventional view that raising the
minimum wage prices people out of jobs. On average, the restaurants that had
to increase their wages by more tended also to have a larger increase in
employment, as the right-hand chart shows. Each dot signifies one
restaurant's growth of wages and full-time employment. There are many
outliers; but the upward sloping 'best-fit' line between the dots indicates
a positive, and statistically significant, relationship between higher
mandated wage growth and higher employment. A 10 per cent wage increase is
predicted to raise relative full-time employment by 25 per cent.
The survey does not suggest that raising the minimum wage increases
unemployment, at least among hamburger-flippers. One explanation is that
fast-food restaurants can impose below-market wages on their existing
employees but have to raise them to market rates in order to attract new
employees. Only when the government mandates this general wage increase does
expansion become profitable. But the result is not more skilled employment,
as Labour would have us believe. Moreover, the same argument would not apply
to internationally competitive industries; a similar study of textile
companies could well give the more conventional result. But the US evidence
does counsel against confident empirical generalisations.
