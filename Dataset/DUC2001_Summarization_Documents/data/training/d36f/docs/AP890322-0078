   Backers of House legislation to raise the
minimum wage lowered their target to $4.55 an hour on the eve of
debate as President Bush declared he had the votes to sustain a veto
should Congress go above $4.25.
   The Democratic sponsors of the bill, scheduled for floor debate
beginning today, also agreed Tuesday to include a sub-minimum
training wage in their measure, a 60-day proposal that falls far
short of the six-month period demanded by Bush.
   And the president, at a White House meeting with reporters,
insisted he had made his best and last offer to raise the wage,
which has been frozen for eight years.
   Bush appeared with Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, who was there
to deliver a letter from 35 Republican senators who promised to side
with Bush should he veto minimum-wage legislation that fails to meet
White House guidelines.
   The administration guidelines include raising the minimum wage,
now at $3.35 an hour, to $4.25 an hour by 1992, provided employers
can pay new hires a ``training wage'' of $3.35 an hour for six
months. The administration says the sub-minimum wage is needed for
employers to create and fill entry-level jobs.
   Mrs. Dole, appearing today on ``CBS This Morning,'' said, ``Many
more jobs and job opportunities are saved if you have a six-month
training wage.''
   The minimum wage ``is not the tool for lifting people out of
poverty. Most people on minimum wage are very young, they are
part-time workers ... they're living at home and they're not in
poverty,'' Mrs. Dole said. ``If we are trying to lift people out of
poverty, let's go to other means such as training and education and
literacy.''
   ``There's enough votes in our grasp here to see that we don't
bust the budget and increase the pressures on inflation by going
beyond that which the secretary and I have agreed on,'' Bush said
Tuesday. ``We've thought out a level of increase on the minimum wage
that would help people and yet would not add gasoline to any
inflation fires that are burning.''
   The 35 senators, if their support for Bush held, would leave
Democrats short of the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto.
   ``For eight years this same coalition of Republican senators has
blocked any increase in the minimum wage,'' said Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., sponsor of a Senate bill to raise the minimum wage
to $4.65 by 1992. ``Every American who works for a living deserves a
living wage, not a sub-poverty wage.''
   Senate floor action is still pending on Kennedy's bill.
   The bill due for House debate today calls for raising the minimum
wage to $4.65 by 1992 and has no provision for a sub-minimum
training wage, an idea long opposed by the sponsors and organized
labor, which has been lobbying heavily against such proposals.
   But the sponsors, facing mounting pressure from the White House
and moderate Democrats, agreed to scale back the final level to
$4.55 and add a training wage in an amendment worked out Tuesday
that has the support of the House leadership.
   At the same time, however, they said they would move up the
effective date of the initial increase, to $3.85 an hour, to Oct. 1,
three months earlier than had been planned. The amendment, to be
offered Thursday, calls for then boosting the minimum wage to $4.25
on Oct. 1, 1990, and to $4.55 a year later.
   The 60-day training wage would apply only to new entrants in the
job market, exclude agricultural workers, and expire on Sept. 30,
1992, according to aides. The training wage would initially be $3.35
an hour but would increase to 85 percent of the subsequent increases
in the minimum wage.
   Workers hired to fill jobs that had been vacated by recent
layoffs could not be paid the training wage, a provision designed to
prevent abuse of the system in order to pay lower wages.
