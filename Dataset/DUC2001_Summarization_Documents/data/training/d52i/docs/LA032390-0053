<P>
Former tanker skipper Joseph Hazelwood, accused of being drunk, reckless and 
most responsible for the nation's worst oil spill, was acquitted of all but a 
minor pollution charge by an Alaskan jury Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In a crowded courtroom that included his wife and father, Hazelwood, 43, was 
found not guilty of felony mischief, operating a vessel while under the 
influence of alcohol and reckless endangerment. 
</P>
<P>
The lone guilty verdict was for the negligent discharge of oil, a misdemeanor 
carrying a maximum penalty of 90 days in jail and a $1,000 fine, far less than 
the 7 years and $61,000 fine he faced if convicted on all counts. 
</P>
<P>
The verdicts came two days before the anniversary of the grounding of the Exxon 
Valdez, which spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil into Alaska's Prince 
William Sound after slamming into a reef and ripping open its hull. 
</P>
<P>
The jury deliberated less than 11 hours. Bursts of applause greeted each "not 
guilty" verdict read by Judge Karl Johnstone. Attorney Michael Chalos 
triumphantly slammed the defense table with his fist when the felony charge 
fell first. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not done. We're going to appeal that misdemeanor, but we're very happy 
that all the serious charges were rejected," Chalos said later. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing was set for this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the appeal results, however, legal problems stemming from the 
grounding of the Exxon Valdez will continue to haunt Hazelwood and his former 
employer, Exxon Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The company still faces federal criminal charges, and Hazelwood is named in 
about 150 civil lawsuits seeking financial damages for the oil spill that 
polluted hundreds of miles of Alaskan shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear how Hazelwood's exoneration on serious criminal charges might 
affect those other cases, but state prosecutors had argued at the close of 
Hazelwood's trial that Exxon would benefit from an acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors were clearly swayed by defense arguments that the disastrous grounding 
was an accident, not a crime. Some members of the panel said after the verdict 
that they felt Hazelwood had been negligent, but not criminally reckless, when 
he left the bridge about 12 to 15 minutes before the accident. 
</P>
<P>
The bearded Hazelwood was as stoic in victory as he had been through more than 
seven weeks of trial, but he smiled broadly as reporters and television cameras 
mobbed the defense table moments after the jury was polled. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just relieved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been long and difficult. I was a pretty anonymous character up until 
about a year ago," Hazelwood told reporters outside the courthouse. "I'm going 
to try to get on with my life now. I'd like to go back to sea. . . . It's what 
I do." 
</P>
<P>
His attorney said that Hazelwood may talk to Exxon about reinstatement and 
would fight an expected U.S. Coast Guard effort to revoke his master's license. 
"The only job he ever had was working on tankers owned or operated by Exxon, so 
I suspect that's what he wants to do is go back to work as a captain," Chalos 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Morakis, a spokesman for Exxon in New York, said the company, which has 
fired Hazelwood, was "pleased that the ordeal of the trial is over for captain 
Hazelwood and his family. 
</P>
<P>
"The verdict would seem to confirm the view that the grounding of the Exxon 
Valdez was an accident," Morakis said. "In light of pending litigation, any 
other comment would be inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
After the verdict, jury foreman Lori Wing stood and smiled at Hazelwood, 
wishing him "good luck" before disappearing into the judge's chambers with her 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood's tearful father, airline pilot Joseph O. Hazelwood, pushed through 
the media throng to embrace Chalos and greet his son. Suzanne Hazelwood, the 
former captain's wife, reached through the crowd to squeeze her husband's hand, 
then hurried from the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the courtroom, Hazelwood at one point broke away from his attorneys to 
shake hands with one of the jurors, Jeffrey Sage, a 28-year-old grocery 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad to see justice done, Mr. Hazelwood," Sage said. "So am I. Thank you," 
Hazelwood responded. 
</P>
<P>
Sage, whose sister was killed by a drunk driver more than 10 years ago, 
ridiculed the state's drunk driving case against Hazelwood. He noted, for 
example, testimony of the 21 witnesses who saw Hazelwood before and after the 
grounding, all of whom said he did not appear to be under the influence of 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
"For him to have had as much to drink as the state said he did, he would've had 
to crawl back to the ship," Sage scoffed. "He would've been dead." 
</P>
<P>
The key sobriety test, taken 10 hours after the grounding, proved only that the 
captain's blood alcohol level was .061%, slightly above the Coast Guard's 
permissible level but well below the state's .10% minimum standard. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors brought in an Oklahoma toxicologist who used a complicated, and 
scientifically controversial, formula to estimate that Hazelwood was legally 
drunk when he sailed from Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
The defense argued that Hazelwood, alone in his cabin and believing that his 
career had just ended on Bligh Reef, drank after the accident and skewed the 
test results. No evidence of that was presented during the trial, however, and 
Hazelwood did not testify. 
</P>
<P>
Sage also said the panel concluded that Hazelwood's orders before and after the 
grounding "all were prudent and precise. He was not impaired." 
</P>
<P>
Fellow juror Terrill Smith said the panel was leaning to acquittal from the 
very first ballot, although it took some time to reach unanimous agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The incident that provoked the most discussion, the two jurors said, was 
Hazelwood's absence from the bridge, leaving his third mate responsible for 
steering around ice floes. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Brent Cole had argued that was an example of criminal recklessness. 
The jury agreed with the defense, which noted that Hazelwood had given the 
correct course instructions and was not behaving differently than other 
captains in similar situations. 
</P>
<P>
Both jurors also criticized the Coast Guard, which operates a $70-million 
vessel traffic center in Valdez. Coast Guard radar operators had failed to 
alert the Exxon Valdez that it was heading for the rocks of Bligh Reef. 
</P>
<P>
"They obviously weren't doing their jobs," Sage said of the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the issue of who is to blame for the disastrous effects of the spill 
remains unresolved, at least to some extent. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers had complained since the outset that Hazelwood was being held 
responsible not only for the grounding -- which they conceded was "a tragic 
accident" -- but also for the "botched containment and cleanup." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people shared the blame for what happened, but all sides were trying 
to sink captain Hazelwood. The state of Alaska, the Coast Guard, the federal 
government, they all wanted him to be their scapegoat," said Tom Russo, another 
defense attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps now people will look beyond the captain." 
</P>
<P>
Environmental groups quickly reacted to the verdict by agreeing with the 
defense characterization of Hazelwood as a scapegoat. "Exxon, not one of its 
employees, should have been tried," said Robert H. Sulnick, executive director 
of Santa Monica-based American Oceans Campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Manheim, spokesman for the Environmental Defense Fund in Washington, 
D.C., said "we think Mr. Hazelwood has been to some extent set up by that 
corporation as a scapegoat and that Exxon is the real culprit in this 
disaster," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska Atty. Gen. Douglas Baily said at a news conference in Juneau that he was 
pleased with the verdict and had congratulated the prosecutors on the single 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
He said the prosecution had proceeded against Hazelwood "certainly not as a 
scapegoat, but as a result of his own involvement as we saw it. It was always 
my view that the captain of that vessel is ultimately responsible." 
</P>
<P>
Former Valdez Mayor John Devins said Hazelwood was never the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"The real issue confronting the state of Alaska is whether industry is prepared 
to prevent another oil spill," said Devins, now a candidate for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood's legal battles began within a few days of the grounding. He was 
still in Valdez when the Coast Guard served a summons notifying the captain 
that his license would be reviewed. Exxon immediately fired the skipper. 
</P>
<P>
Relieved of command and a job, and with his personal security in some doubt, 
the grounded captain drove to Anchorage and flew home to Huntington, Long 
Island, apparently unaware that local law enforcement officials were preparing 
a criminal action against him. 
</P>
<P>
In the next few days, Hazelwood would become the object of a highly publicized 
manhunt launched by embarrassed Alaskan officials who didn't know he had left 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, however, accompanied by his attorneys, Hazelwood surrendered 
to a court near his Long Island home. Amid a circus of reporters and TV 
cameras, a Suffolk County judge accused Hazelwood of complicity in an 
environmental disaster comparable to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. 
</P>
<P>
Bail was set at $1 million. Hazelwood spent a night in the county jail before 
an appeals court reduced it to $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Last May a grand jury in Alaska added the most serious charge -- a felony count 
of criminal mischief that carried a potential penalty of five years in prison 
-- setting the stage for the trial that began Feb. 5.
