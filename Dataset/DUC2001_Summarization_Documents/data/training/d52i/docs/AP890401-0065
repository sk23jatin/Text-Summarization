the oil tanker Exxon Valdez on a reef in Alaska's Prince William
Sound, based on Coast Guard transmissions monitored in Washington:

the water are ``being prepared ... for delivery and deployment.''

Guard officers and Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation
pollution personnel to the Exxon Valdez.

the ship remained moored on the reef.
   2:27 a.m. _ A merchant ship reports the oil slick a half mile
south of the Exxon Valdez.
