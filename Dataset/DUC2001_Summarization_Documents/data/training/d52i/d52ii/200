One of the petroleum industry's worst disasters occurred on March 24,
1989, at 12:04 local time, when the Exxon oil tanker, Valdez, carrying
1.26 million barrels of crude oil, ran aground in Alaska's Prince
William Sound.  The tanker had been detouring around ice in the
treacherous sound.  Immediate reactions included closing Port Valdez
and dispatching a Coast Guard tug.

Almost 26 million barrels of crude were spilled.  More than 1,000
miles of shoreline were polluted and 1,000 sea otters, 140 bald
eagles, and 36,500 sea birds were killed.  The clean-up operation in
1989 alone involved 12,000 workers, 1,300 vessels and cost Exxon $1.9
billion.  No people were killed or seriously injured, but the fishing
industry was disrupted.  The flow of Alaskan oil was cut by 60 percent
from March 24 until April 5.  By September 1989, Exxon had paid-out
$90 million in damage claims.

Exxon fired the ship's captain, Joseph Hazelwood, on March 30, 1989.
He was tried in Alaska for various crimes but only found guilty of the
negligent discharge of oil.  His defense had called the incident an
accident, not a crime.  Hazelwood was still named in 150 civil
lawsuits and Exxon and its subsidiary were indicted on federal
criminal charges.  </SUM>
