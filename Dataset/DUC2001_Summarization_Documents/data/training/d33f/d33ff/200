Hong Kong's new Governor, Chris Patten, has pressed China to accept
his proposals for political development or make alternatives.  He is
at an impasse with Lu Ping, director of China's office of Hong Kong
and Macau affairs on financing a new airport project.  China will
repudiate any of the colony's agreements if not pre-approved by
Beijing.  Although Patten has modified some positions, he believes
that Hong Kong is best suited to act in its own interests and when
Chinese consultation is required, nothing works.  The Chinese believe
that Patten is anti-China and cite as evidence his continuing
reference to Hong Kong as an "international asset" showing that
Britain does not want to return the colony.  China advances the "one
country, two systems" policy and say that the capitalist, not the
socialist, system will be practiced in Hong Kong when it becomes a
"special administrative region" of China in 1997.  The Chinese
recognize the need for British cooperation, but they and the British
disagree on the venue: Lu Ping believes it to be the Preliminary
Working Group and Patten the Joint Liaison Group.  The airport problem
was settled and the major remaining problem is the continuity of the
civil service.  </SUM>
