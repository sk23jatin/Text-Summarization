Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten and Lu Ping, director of China's
Office of Hong Kong and Macau Affairs generally find little agreement.
Lu Ping accuses Patten of duplicity and Patten sees Hong Kong
operating best in its own interests free from Chinese
consultation. The Chinese doubt that the British want to return the
colony to China. The colony will become a "special administrative
region" of China in 1997, still operating as a capitalist system under
China's "one country, two systems" plan. The Chinese want negotiations
with the British in the Preliminary Working Group, but Patten wants
the Joint Liaison Group.  </SUM>
