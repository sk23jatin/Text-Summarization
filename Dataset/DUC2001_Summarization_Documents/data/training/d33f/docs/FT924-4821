CHINA yesterday delivered an open challenge to Britain's continued
administration of Hong Kong when it said it would repudiate all commercial
agreements made by the colonial government that were not first agreed with
Beijing.
The challenge was immediately rejected by the Hong Kong government, which
accused China of violating Anglo-Chinese agreements and its own law for Hong
Kong which comes into force after the colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty
in June 1997.
The statement by the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office was seen in the
colony as an attempt by China to undermine confidence in Hong Kong's economy
and to defeat proposals by Mr Chris Patten, the governor, for more
democratic elections due in 1995. It represents a serious escalation in the
row which Beijing has linked to London's change in policy towards Hong
Kong's democratic development. Analysts in Hong Kong said it also amounted
to a bid by China for greater involvement in the colony's administration.
'They want to bring the government to its knees, if they can,' a senior Hong
Kong government official said last night.
The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the Chinese government, in a
dispatch released through the Xinhua News Agency in Beijing, said that all
contracts, leases and agreements signed and ratified by the Hong Kong
government would be invalid after June 30 1997 unless they were first
approved by China.
It added, however, that China encouraged foreign investment in Hong Kong.
In London, the Foreign Office rejected Beijing's threat, saying it was
contrary to the 1990 Basic Law for Hong Kong.
In the absence of a British climbdown on democracy, or the defeat of Mr
Patten's proposals on the floor of the local legislature, China's escalating
attacks could undermine some large-scale business ventures in energy,
communications and trade which are planned for Hong Kong in addition to the
colony's HKDollars 175bn (Pounds 15bn) airport project.
Hong Kong's financial and business community was last night deeply concerned
about the growing rift between London and Beijing and is expected to voice
louder calls for Mr Patten to retreat. Liberal politicians said China's
behaviour underlined the need for democracy to protect Hong Kong from the
arbitrary exercise of power by Beijing.
British and US businesses with interests in Hong Kong were more sanguine
about prospects for the colony, indicating that Beijing's threat would have
no impact on investment decisions.
Share prices on the Hong Kong stock exchange fell nearly 3 per cent in
trading yesterday, although this was largely in response to comments by a
senior Chinese official late last week over the validity of the award of
land to a consortium to build a container terminal in Hong Kong. The warning
from Beijing yesterday came too late to affect the market.
The Hong Kong government responded to China's latest attack by declaring
that Beijing was in breach of both the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration
on Hong Kong's future and the 1990 Basic Law - the colony's post-1997
constitution - drafted by Beijing.
Both documents guarantee the safety of existing contracts after the colony
reverts to Chinese sovereignty.
