MR Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, yesterday gave China until the end of
the year to accept his proposals for the colony's political development or
to present alternatives that would be acceptable to the people of Hong Kong.
After more than six hours of discussions with Lu Ping, director of the
Chinese cabinet's office of Hong Kong and Macao affairs, Mr Patten said: 'I
cannot say we reached a meeting of minds on what I put forward.'
He also indicated that they achieved little progress in settling the impasse
over the financing of Hong Kong's new airport project. Mr Patten said that
they had agreed the best forum for settlement was the Airport Committee of
the Anglo-Chinese Joint Liaison Group - a place where consensus has been
stalled for months.
This is Mr Patten's first visit to China as governor of Hong Kong. He leaves
for the colony tomorrow after discussions today with Chinese trade
officials.
It emerged last night that Li Peng, China's prime minister, had refused to
see him. Instead he will meet Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister.
On October 7, Mr Patten presented plans for the conduct of the colony's 1994
local and 1995 legislative elections which provide for much greater
democracy than has previously been the case in Hong Kong.
In considering alternatives to these plans, the governor said he was guided
by three principles. They should be 'fair', 'open and honest', and
'acceptable to the people of Hong Kong', he said.
Mr Patten said that he was prepared to meet Lu 'at any time and in any
place' to reach agreement but had reminded the Chinese they had only until
the end of the year.
He said the legislative timetable demanded that bills be put before the
Legislative Council (LegCo), the colony's unicameral legislature, early in
the new year to give effect to the planned changes for the 1994 and 1995
elections.
Although Mr Patten did not say so yesterday, he has suggested in the past
that he would be prepared to introduce his proposals for a slightly faster
pace of democratic development in Hong Kong without China's approval.
He went out of his way, however, to praise Lu - the man who holds day-to-day
responsibility for ensuring a smooth transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong
in 1997. He lauded the manner in which Lu put forward China's position but
was less than pleased with what he had to say.
Mr Patten would give only few details of Lu's response to his proposals. He
said that Lu pointed out the existence of the Basic Law - the
Beijing-drafted constitution for Hong Kong post-1997. (This has become
Chinese code for 'no change'.)
'I am bound to say I don't think this answers some of the problems I have to
disentangle before the end of this year,' the governor said.
His visit has been preceded by a barrage of criticism of himself and his
proposals, in the pro-Beijing Hong Kong press, not seen since the Cultural
Revolution of the 1960s and early 1970s.
Mr Patten's defeat in the British parliamentary election earlier this year
has been used to suggest he is a failed politician.
