"Confession by the Last Governor of Hong Kong"] 
  [Text] Recently, Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten published 
an article entitled "Go Against the North Wind." The meaning is 
quite clear: To go against China through to the end on the Hong 
Kong issue. 
  Why has Chris Patten no scruples about declaring his stand 
of 
going against China through to the end? Just as he said in his 
article, the reason is that what he has done since he became 
governor of Hong Kong has been criticized and condemned not only 
by China and people of Hong Kong, but also by people in Britain. 
He said: "Some criticisms have appeared in both Britain and 
Hong Kong." But he also found excuses to console himself: "In 
an open and free society, such criticisms may appear." As a 
mater of fact, if there had only been "some" criticisms, there 
was no need for the governor to personally write such a long 
article to explain himself over such trifles. 
  The most important point of the article is that Chris Patten 
was trying hard to explain that all he had done was in the 
interests of the Hong Kong people. He wrote: "Our 
responsibility toward the citizens of Hong Kong should be put 
first." This British Hong Kong governor is really more 
concerned about Hong Kong than the Hong Kong people. For this 
reason, he feels it unfair that the Hong Kong people are 
criticizing and condemning him instead of saying thank you to 
him. But for the Hong Kong people, of course the Hong Kong 
Chinese, what should be put first is certainly that they should 
be treated as real Chinese people of China rather than a 
conquered people in a colony, and the first responsibility of 
Britain is to ensure a smooth return of Hong Kong to China in 
accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration. 
  In fact, responsibility toward the citizens of Hong Kong 
advocated by Chris Patten is actually for the colonialist 
interests of the British Empire. Some people criticized what he 
had done as "jeopardizing more extensive Sino-British 
relations." To refute this criticism he said: "Hong Kong is 
the biggest and most important component part of these 
relations." What is more, "judging from a long-term point of 
view, our position in China and Asia may, to a great extent, be 
decided by how we discharge our responsibility in Hong Kong in a 
dignified manner." 
  People cannot but ask: Why is Hong Kong the biggest and most 
important part of Sino-British relations? To the Chinese 
people, the following is understandable: Hong Kong was 
plundered after the Opium War, a war of aggression launched by 
Britain against China. The Chinese people will never forget this 
national humiliation. If this humiliation is not wiped out, 
there can be no harmonious Sino- British relations. 
  However, this is obviously not what Chris Patten meant. Then 
what did he mean by saying Hong Kong is the "biggest and most 
important" part of Sino-British relations? Did he mean that the 
British Empire will not resign itself to the return of its 
richest colony to China, the rightful owner? 
  People will also ask: Why will the position of Britain in 
China and Asia be decided by how Britain discharges its 
responsibility in Hong Kong in a dignified manner? What 
position does Britain want to have in China and in Asia? What 
is the meaning of a "dignified manner"? If Britain ensures a 
smooth return of Hong Kong to China in accordance with the 
Sino-British Joint Declaration, is it not a practice in a 
"dignified manner?" Can it not help improve the image of 
Britain and increase its position in China and Asia? Does 
Britain really want to return Hong Kong to China only in name 
while preserving its position as the "governor" to show the 
power and prestige of the British Empire and go on playing the 
tyrant in China and Asia as a colonialist? In this respect, 
what Chris Patten meant is quite clear. 
  In his article, Chris Patten brutally attacked China as a 
"villain." In fact, this is the right word for Mr. Patten 
himself. He threatened that if China did not obey the 
"governor's" arrangement, it should not expect Britain would 
agree to its return to GATT. 
  Although Chris Patten has taken great pains to protect the 
interests of the British Empire, he is not admired by some 
domestic opinion. Instead, he has been criticized and 
condemned. That is why he feels somewhat wronged. 
  Chris Patten, the last governor of Hong Kong, has been 
trying 
hard to preserve an actual colonial position in Hong Kong and 
revitalize the colonialist power and prestige of the old British 
Empire. Unfortunately, all this is but a day dream. 
  This article is actually a confession by Chris Patten, who 
has been driven to the wall, to prove his loyalty to British 
colonialism.
