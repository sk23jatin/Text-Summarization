<F P=106> [By XINHUA correspondent Feng Xiuju: "Patten's Bill </F>
Passage, a Long Premeditated Action"] 
  [Text] Beijing, February 26 (XINHUA) -- The recent passage 
of Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's partial electoral bill by 
its Legislative Council (Legco) was not accidental, but long 
premeditated. 
  The step was taken in disregard of repeated persuasion by 
China and the aspirations of all the social strata in Hong Kong 
for a settlement of the electoral arrangements through talks. 
  Over the past two days, the British side also published a 
white paper and unilaterally made public the contents of last 
year's 17 rounds of Sino-British talks on the arrangements for 
the 1994-1995 elections in Hong Kong. 
  In addition, the Hong Kong Government gazetted the remaining 
part of Patten's reform package on Friday [25 February]. 
  This string of actions is the inevitable result of the 
change 
of Britain's policies toward China and its stubborn perseverance 
in violating the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the principle 
of convergence with the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region and the relevant agreements and 
understandings reached between the two countries. 
  These actions fully show that the British side has closed 
the 
door of negotiations between the two sides and is finally taking 
a road of confrontation with China on the issue of Hong Kong's 
political system. 
  None of the Chinese people, including the Hong Kong 
compatriots, can ever tolerate such kind of actions. 
  It is known to all that shortly after Patten became Hong 
Kong 
governor in 1992, he began to sell his political bill step by 
step under the pretence of increasing democracy in Hong Kong, in 
an attempt to change Hong Kong's present political structure and 
pull the pro-British elements and those who are opposed to China 
onto the political stage, so as to turn Hong Kong into an 
independent or semi-independent political entity which cannot be 
controlled by the central government of China after 1997. 
  The following facts clearly show his real intention. 
  First, Patten tabled his political reform bill in October, 
1992, in a sudden manner, without consulting with China, thus 
sabotaging the Sino-British consultations and cooperation of the 
past ten years since they negotiated and signed the joint 
declaration, and bringing about a half-year-long open argument 
between the two countries. 
  Then Britain, under all sorts of pressure, agreed to hold 
talks with China in April last year on the arrangements for 
elections for 1994/1995 in Hong Kong. 
  However, at the negotiating table the British side 
repeatedly 
adopted double-faced tactics. It spoke fine words while 
blocking the progress of talks by setting up various barriers. 
As a result, the talks could not be moved forward. 
  Later, when the two sides almost reached identical views on 
the arrangements for elections of municipal councils and the 
district boards, the British side intentionally confused these 
elections with that of the Legislative Council and unilaterally 
terminated the talks and then introduced the first part of the 
package to the Legislative Council last December. 
  Even so, China made it clear repeatedly that for the Chinese 
side the door for negotiations was open, with the prerequisite 
that the British side must withdraw the submitted partial bill 
from the Legco. 
  But the British side ignored this and was the first to walk 
away from the negotiating table, thus completely closing the 
door of negotiations. 
  The above-mentioned facts demonstrate that the British side 
has had no sincerity at all on cooperation with China in the 
three crucial periods, namely, prior to the talks, in the 
process of the talks and leading to the break-down of the talks. 
  On the contrary, it has walked far along the road of 
confrontation with China. 

    Recently, Patten made a special trip to Australia and tried 
his best to win support from outside Hong Kong for the passage 
and the implementation of his political bill. 
  Shortly after Patten returned to Hong Kong at the end of his 
trip to Australia on February 19, his partial electoral bill was 
passed by the Legislative Council. 
  Meanwhile, Britain also issued a white paper. 
  Over the past year or more, Patten has directed so many 
farces which converged so closely that it is clear that what he 
did was carefully arranged and long premeditated. 
  The British side time and again said that Patten's political 
bill was aimed at promoting Hong Kong's prosperity and stability 
and completely considered the aspirations of the Hong Kong 
residents. 
  It is known to all that to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity 
and stability and to ensure its smooth transition in 1997 are in 
the fundamental interests of the Hong Kong residents. 
  The Basic Law was formulated after more than four years' 
discussions and drafting, and fully absorbing opinions of the 
Hong Kong residents. Its most important principle is to 
maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. 
  The preamble and the general principles of the Basic Law 
stipulate that the socialist system and policies shall not be 
practised in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and 
the previous capitalist system and way of life shall remain 
unchanged for 50 years. 
  Article 45 and article 68 of the Basic Law also stipulate 
that Hong Kong's political system should be developed "in the 
light of the actual situation" and "in accordance with the 
principle of gradual and orderly progress". 
  These principles aim at precisely guaranteeing Hong Kong's 
stable development, stable transfer of its power, and steady 
establishment of the government of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region and Legislative Council. 
  Therefore, the principles in the Basic Law accepted by the 
Hong Kong residents conform to the fundamental interests and 
opinions of the Hong Kong people. 
  However, Patten hurriedly put forward his political reform 
bill less than three months after he began to serve as Hong Kong 
governor, without absorbing opinions from the Hong Kong 
residents. More serious was that, despite strong appeals from 
Hong Kong residents for the settlement of the electoral 
arrangements through talks, the political reform bill submitted 
by Patten was passed. How can people say that it reflects the 
opinions and interests of the Hong Kong residents? 
  The Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law 
stipulate that the British administration of Hong Kong will 
terminate on June 30, 1997, and the Chinese Government will 
resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong as of July 1, 
1997. 
  In accordance with these provisions, the Chinese side has 
reiterated that as component parts of the British political body 
administering Hong Kong, the last British-Hong Kong district 
boards, the two municipal polls and the Legislative Council will 
definitely be terminated together with the end of the British 
administration of Hong Kong. 
  Before the Chinese and British sides reach an agreement on 
the arrangements for the 1994/1995 elections, the three-level 
bodies produced on the basis of the partial electoral bill 
passed by the British-Hong Kong Legco or any other electoral 
bill possibly yet to be passed by the Legco cannot remain beyond 
the year 1997. 
  It would be a vain fantasy to think that the passed bill 
will 
be fixed in the form of law and the three-level bodies produced 
from the bill can be automatically extended beyond the year 1997. 
  Time is advancing and the destiny of Hong Kong in future 
will 
be in the hands of the Chinese people, including the Hong Kong 
compatriots. 
  No matter how far the British side will walk along the road 
of confrontation with China on the issue of Hong Kong's 
political system, it absolutely cannot prevent the progress of 
history. 
  China holds that as long as the Hong Kong compatriots and 
the 
mainland people closely cooperate and completely implement the 
principle of "one country, two systems", the future of Hong Kong 
will be bright.
