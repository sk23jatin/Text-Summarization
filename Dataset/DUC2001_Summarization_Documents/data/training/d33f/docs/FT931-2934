CHINA stepped up the war of words over the future of Hong Kong yesterday,
threatening to ignore the results of democratic elections proposed by Mr
Chris Patten, the colony's governor, once it assumes control in 1997.
It also accused him of slamming the door on further talks.
Mr Lu Ping, China's senior official for Hong Kong affairs, said that if Mr
Patten pressed ahead with his democratic reforms Beijing would start a 'new
kitchen' in 1997 - a Chinese expression which means making a fresh start.
Mr Lu also added his voice to personal criticism of the governor, saying
that he would be condemned by history over his handling of the Hong Kong
issue.
Speaking at a Beijing press conference, he left the door open, however, for
further contacts with Britain, saying that China 'always stands for
co-operation, and not confrontation'.
In London, the Foreign Office stressed that it was still offering 'talks at
any time'. An official added: 'The only sensible way forward is for the two
sides to sit down and discuss without preconditions the points of difference
between us.'
The remarks by Mr Lu, head of China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs office,
were greeted with relief by the Hong Kong stock market, which had been
bracing itself for a more uncompromising stand.
The Hang Seng index was some 200 points down before Mr Lu's press
conference, but recovered most of its losses to close at 5,958.33, down 21.7
on the day.
Mr Lu said: 'We will construct a kitchen in accordance with the design in
the Basic Law. We have to do this because the kitchen started by Mr Chris
Patten before 1997 will not converge with the stipulations of the Basic Law
after 1997.'
The Basic Law is a mini-constitution for Hong Kong after 1997 which was
approved by China's parliament in 1990.
Mr Lu said China would have to make preparations ahead of 1997 for the
cancellation of Mr Patten's proposed democratic reforms; but he stopped
short of saying China would set up an alternative administration in Hong
Kong before the end of British rule.
He also refrained from repeating economic threats made by China last year,
although it seems unlikely that Britain will win China's agreement to
complete Hong Kong's Dollars 175bn (Pounds 123bn) airport project, or
further develop the colony's container port.
In Beijing, Sir Robin McLaren, Britain's ambassador, regretted the
continuing personal attacks on Mr Patten. He said that decisions over Hong
Kong were 'taken by the British government as a whole'.
In Hong Kong, Mr Patten reiterated his preparedness to hold talks with China
about his proposed 1994-95 elections. But in spite of the governor's
attempts to calm growing concerns over the row with Beijing, local
politicians were pessimistic about an early solution.
