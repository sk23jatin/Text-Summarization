  [Text] [Begin recording] [Lu] We feel that the British 
Hong Kong Government has closed the door on contact with the 
Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] too tight. We feel there is no 
need to do so. Therefore, under such circumstances, I, as vice 
chairman of the PWC, and the Governor of Hong Kong, who should 
be considered the head of Hong Kong's civil service, since he 
does not allow contacts between civil servants and the PWC, what 
is the basis for me, a member of the PWC, to have contacts with 
him? [sentence as heard] 
  [Patten] I must say that like the overwhelming majority of 
people in Hong Kong, like a number of members of the PWC, I 
think it is a great pity that we are, as it were, communicating 
through television, rather than sitting down at the table 
talking to one another. [end recording] 
  [Anchorman Yuan Chi-wei] Good evening. Lu Ping, director of 
the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the Chinese State 
Council, has been visiting Hong Kong in the capacity of 
secretary general and vice chairman of the PWC. Though Hong 
Kong Governor Chris Patten said time and again that he is 
willing to meet Lu Ping at any time, Lu Ping has consistently 
refused to meet him. However, Director Lu Ping and Hong Kong 
Governor Chris Patten granted separate exclusive interviews to 
the Information Department of Hong Kong Television Broadcasts 
Limited and expressed their opinions on some issues in dispute 
between China and Britain. Lu Ping reiterated that one of the 
main reasons why he refused to meet Chris Patten is that the 
British side barred civil servants from meeting the PWC. But 
Patten responded by saying: 
  [Begin recording] [Patten] I repeat we are not against 
giving information to the PWC. But the PWC is China's creation, 
China's appointment. The Joint Liaison Group is the result of 
an agreement enshrined in a treaty between Britain and China, 
which is supposed to be working in the interests of Hong Kong. 
Why seek to replicate that if that is the purpose? What we 
want to do is to ensure that China and Britain work in that 
cooperative spirit which the Joint Declaration commits us to. 
  [Lu] We have an old saying in China, which goes: "Listen to 
his words and watch his deeds." You should take some action to 
prove that you are truly willing to cooperate with the Chinese 
side in solving these problems. Only when this happens can we 
have a basis for talks. That is why we now suggest establishing 
some contacts through various other channels. 
  [Patten] Here we are in a position in which we have got 
agreed channels between Hong Kong and China and Britain, agreed 
channels which, alas, have not been working terribly well. 
People in Hong Kong, I think, scratch their heads about why it 
is that after all these months, years we have not got an airport 
agreement, why we are not making more progress on things like 
the localization and adaptation of laws, why we have not got an 
agreement on the container terminal, and so on. And I think it 
is imperative that we get the existing channels to work. I am 
not against giving information to the PWC. We give information 
to all sorts of groups. 
  [Lu] Initially, our economic subgroup made an appointment 
with the president of the Kowloon-Canton Railway [KCR] to tell 
us something about the company's development strategy. The main 
reason we wanted to know its development strategy is to find out 
how it can dovetail with the mainland railway development 
strategy. 
  As far as we know, the existing railway planning in Hong 
Kong 
does not reflect consideration on how to connect with the 
mainland railway system. They have a plan for stretching into 
the territory of Shenzhen via Huanggang; but this will not work, 
because according to Shenzhen's plan, Huanggang will become an 
urban center of Shenzhen, which cannot possibly have a railway 
cutting across it. In such a situation, the two sides should 
coordinate and cooperate with each other. This is the very 
reason we invited the KCR president to explain this matter. 
  First, he agreed to come and the time and place were also 
fixed. But just now we were told he was not coming. The KCR 
president is not a civil servant; he cannot be counted as a 
civil servant. If someone in the capacity of the Kowloon-Canton 
Railway Corporation president is unwilling to have contacts with 
us, how can you convince us that the British side is willing to 
cooperate with the Chinese side in other fields? 
  [Patten] If Director Lu Ping had wanted to talk about 
infrastructure, I would have been delighted to do so. We will 
shortly want to talk to the Chinese authorities about the 
outcome of our railway development strategy, which is absolutely 
vital to the communication links of Hong Kong in the future. I 
am bound to say that the first I heard about a meeting with the 
head of the KCR was when I heard what Director Lu Ping had said, 
but I do not know any more details about the alleged KCR meeting. 
  [Lu] As I said, the Hong Kong Government's attitude toward 
the PWC is not exactly one of friendliness. We once invited 
officials of the Hong Kong Government to the PWC to explain to 
us the draft regulations of the Airport Authority that they had 
put forward. The main purpose of our invitation was that the 
PWC wished to help bring the airport talks to an early start and 
to an early agreement by discussing the draft regulations of the 
Airport Authority. But after we read the regulations, we were 
not quite clear about some of them, about why they were written 
in certain ways, so we wished that the Hong Kong side could 
explain to us. The main purpose was to promote the airport 
talks. Very unfortunately, however, the Hong Kong side barred 
its civil servants from having contacts with us at the PWC. 
  [Patten] Because at the moment, we put enough burdens on 
the civil service, trying to get, for example, the existing 
channels to work better. Civil servants also have to report to 
Legco [Legislative Council], which is the body that represents 
the people of Hong Kong. 
  [Lu] As you know, to reach an agreement on any issue, the 
mutual understanding and accommodation that you mentioned is 
necessary. Mutual understanding and accommodation means both of 
us give in a bit, after which our two sides can reach an 
agreement. It will not work if only one side, one-way traffic 
[preceding three words in English] is relied on. We have made 
concessions on many issues. For example, on the financing 
arrangements for the airport, we have made big concessions. 
[end recording] 
  [Yuan] Lu Ping kept saying that because the present 
atmosphere is not good, it is not the right time to meet Chris 
Patten. But Patten said that if the atmosphere is not good, the 
best thing to do is to sit down and talk, so as to improve the 
atmosphere. But Lu Ping said one should be more realistic. 
  [Begin recording] [Lu] If we talk, we should talk in a 
cooperative atmosphere in accordance with the Memorandum of 
Understanding on the New Airport. The purpose of my meeting 
with the Governor of Hong Kong would mainly be to talk about how 
to achieve a smooth transition. This requires a cooperative 
atmosphere and a basis on which our talks can yield some 
results. If our talks cannot bring any results, I do not think 
we should waste our time. If the two of us talk for a long time 
and then meet you when we come out, you will ask us if we got 
anywhere after the long talk, and we will say we got nowhere. 
This will be a big disappointment for the people of Hong Kong. 
  [Patten] He talked to you in the week about the atmosphere 
not being conducive to a meeting. If you do not have a good 
atmosphere, the best thing to do is to have a meeting to try to 
make the atmosphere better. I am absolutely sure that the 
overwhelming majority of people in Hong Kong who want us to meet 
and want us to talk these things through in a sensible and 
reasonable way will in due course have their ambitions met, 
because if we are serious about cooperation and the interests of 
Hong Kong, then we have got at some stage to sit round the table 
and then work things out together. 
  [Lu] I think we should be more realistic and the two sides 
should create a better atmosphere. As far as we are concerned, 
the invitations we extended to the Hong Kong Government still 
stand. The PWC's door is always open. The question now is 
whether or not the Hong Kong Government is willing to open this 
door. 
  [Patten] It is a body appointed by Chinese officials to 
advise Chinese officials. Unlike the Joint Liaison Group, it is 
not a result of an agreement between two sovereign powers, 
similarly the Land Commission, similarly the Airport Committee. 
And unlike the Legislative Council, it is not a body which 
represents public opinion right across the board in Hong Kong. 
[end recording] 
  [Yuan] Coming up next is the second part of this program on 
how Lu Ping and Chris Patten look at the Xi Yang incident and 
whether or not the two of them will have a chance to meet each 
other in the future. Stay with us. [at this point program goes 
to commercial break] 
  During our interviews with them, both Lu Ping and Chris 
Patten were asked about the Xi Yang incident. Our reporter 
asked Lu Ping a question about the Xi Yang incident causing the 
people of Hong Kong to worry about the freedom of the press. 
  [Begin recording] [Lu] This is not the case. It has 
nothing to do with Hong Kong's freedom of the press whatsoever, 
because Xi Yang committed the crime within the territory of 
China. Since his crime was committed within China's territory, 
it of course was handled according to China's law. China's law 
is of course not entirely the same as Hong Kong's law. Perhaps, 
if he had committed the crime in Hong Kong, it could have been 
handled differently. But he committed the crime in China's 
territory. No matter who you are, you must observe China's law 
when you are on the land of China. It does not apply to Hong 
Kong people only. If a U.S. citizen commits a crime in China's 
territory, it will also be handled according to China's law. 
This is perfectly justified. So it has nothing to do with Hong 
Kong's freedom of the press at all. It would have been the same 
problem if it had been a U.S. reporter or a British reporter. 
  [Patten] We are not seeking to interfere with somebody 
else's judicial system, not a bit of it. But there was genuine 
surprise in Hong Kong at a sentence handed out to somebody who 
worked for a Hong Kong newspaper for a story which apparently 
appeared on the front page of another Peking-supported newspaper 
in Hong Kong on the same day. And there was great surprise at 
the severity of the sentence for disclosing economic 
information, exactly the sort of thing which helps the Hong Kong 
stock market to spin round day after day. But what we have 
concentrated on is not any of that. What we concentrated on is 
a simple issue: It is very important that journalists in Hong 
Kong know precisely the rules and regulations which they have to 
keep to if they are going to operate reasonably in China; and 
what we do not want is the impression to be created that in 
order, perhaps, to get Hong Kong journalists to write things 
that they perhaps do not really feel or to censor themselves, 
exemplary sentences are going to be handed out, for reasons 
which people cannot understand. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Today, many people in Hong Kong are 
requesting a special amnesty from the Chinese Government for Xi 
Yang. Is such an amnesty possible? 
  [Lu] This is not within my authority. As far as I know, 
there is no provision on special amnesty in China's 
Constitution. No, there is none. 
  [Patten] I am surprised that senior Chinese officials do not 
understand why this case has caused so much concern in Hong 
Kong. Not just a minority that have been worried about it, nor 
just a minority who have been worried about other things that 
have happened in China. It goes across the community. 
  [Lam] Governor, what is your government willing to do to 
safeguard press freedom; for example, the freedom to 
information. And the demand from legislators like Christine Loh, 
do you go for that? 
  [Patten] Well, what we are doing at the moment is looking at 
the suggestions in Christine Loh's bill. We will be responding 
to that very soon and we are also committed to reviewing our 
existing legislation to remove from it provisions which may be 
used by others to abuse press freedom. 
  [Reporter] Some Hong Kong reporters cannot go to Qiandao Hu 
to cover the incident. Is there any explanation? 
  [Lu] As to this issue, I personally feel that it does not 
seem necessary for Hong Kong reporters to boycott news gathering 
in China. I do not see it as necessary. What is the point? 
They are two different things. Why do you have to boycott news 
gathering in China? 
  [Reporter] China rejected their request to cover news in 
China. Was it a retaliatory gesture? 
  [Lu] It is not an issue of retaliation. It is common sense 
that since you have boycotted gathering news in China, why do 
you still want to come? It is okay if you send other reporters 
in. You boycotted, so let someone else take your place. We 
still welcome them to cover news. 
  [Reporter] In that case.... 
  [Lu] You do not have to come yourself, do you? 
  [Reporter] Does it mean that those who once said they would 
boycott news gathering in China will be permanently barred from 
entering the mainland to cover news? 
  [Lu] No, no. Doesn't your boycott also have a timetable? 
To the end of May, I heard? I do not know. I am not quite 
sure. Is it true that the boycott will continue to the end of 
May? Isn't there a deadline, reporters? [end recording] 
  [Yuan] The biggest issue in dispute between China and 
Britain now is Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's constitutional 
reform proposals. Our reporter asked Lu Ping if the Legislative 
Council amends the proposals so that they are in line with the 
Basic Law, will they be acceptable? 
  [Begin recording] [Lu] This is absolutely impossible, 
because there is already an understanding between the two sides 
on how the first government should be formed, that is, the 
Chinese side and the British side should reach an agreement 
through diplomatic channels. No agreement can be reached 
between China and Britain unless it is through diplomatic 
channels. This is not for the Legislative Council to decide. 
It is not for the Legislative Council to lead the Chinese side 
and the British side by the nose. To say the least, the Chinese 
side will not accept being led by the nose by the Hong Kong 
Legislative Council. Therefore, the Chinese side will not 
acknowledge any decision adopted by the Legislative Council. 
This is certain. 
  [Reporter] These days, we in Hong Kong are getting a clear 
message that the three-tier councils must be disbanded and 
reorganized in 1997. But why is the Chinese side so firm on 
this issue and why is this attitude made known even before the 
Hong Kong Legislative Council passes any election proposal? 
  [Lu] We did not make known this attitude just now. 
  [Reporter] But now.... 
  [Lu] After the British side shut the door tight on the 
arrangements for 1994-95 elections and refused carry on with the 
talks with us, we declared our attitude then. This is not a new 
issue. As you should know, in 1997, the kind of change that 
will take place here is not like what happens when the British 
Conservative Party steps down and the Labor Party goes into 
power. It will be a shift from one government to another. 
Normally, under such circumstances, it stands to reason that a 
new government, new legislature, and new judicial body will be 
formed. This is only normal. We adopted the "through train" 
arrangement because it is a special measure. Strictly speaking, 
everything should start anew and setting up a separate kitchen 
should apply to everything. But for the sake of smooth 
transition, we adopted this special measure, namely, the 
"through train" option. Yet this requires a basis, which is the 
British side's cooperation with us and convergence of the 
composition of the last Legislative Council with the provisions 
of the Basic Law. 
  [Patten] Well, there are some things which are in their 
sovereign power which I do not deny at all, though of course I 
would hope they would operate within the terms of their 
international treaty obligations as well: In this case, the 
Joint Declaration. But they can do all sorts of things after 
1997 if they want. What they have to ask themselves is whether 
those things are in the interests of Hong Kong and whether those 
things will help to secure the hearts and minds of the people of 
Hong Kong. 
  [Reporter] Recently, a number of recommendations raised at 
the discussions of the PWC have caused much controversy among 
the people of Hong Kong. The first recommendation is that civil 
servants should make it clear whether or not they want to stay 
in their positions beyond 1997. The more recent one is the 
extension of the operation of the land fund. Do these two 
recommendations indicate that those at the PWC or its members do 
not have a good idea of Hong Kong's reality or the agreements 
previously reached between China and Britain? 
  [Lu] No. This is a sheer misunderstanding. It does not 
mean that the PWC members do not have a good idea of Hong Kong's 
conditions. As far as I know, they did not put it that way and 
the PWC did not discuss it like that. But how did the question 
come up? Well, Cheng Yu-sho conducted a survey, a poll, didn't 
he? The results claimed that by 1997, many civil servants, 
especially senior civil servants and administrative officers, 
will resign. So we said if it is true that so many 
administrative officers will quit, there will be many things 
unattended to. What should we do? 
  In fact, Cheng Yu-sho's survey was not comprehensive and his 
results were impossible. 
  At that point, it was suggested that if a civil servant is 
not willing to go on to work in the Special Administrative 
Region [SAR] Government in 1997, he should notify the 
Preparatory Committee or other authorities beforehand. He 
should do it himself, making it clear that he is not going to 
carry on beyond 1997. This way, the chief executive or other 
chief officials can look for someone at an early stage to 
succeed him, so that the government's operation will not be 
affected or come to a stop. This is how we put it and how we 
discussed it. I do not know why stories came out in the 
newspapers later, claiming that they were asked to declare their 
so-called political stand. I feel this is a pure 
misunderstanding. We did not mean it at all. 
  If you.... [Lu pauses] I believe by 1997, the overwhelming 
majority, 90 percent, of the civil servants will be happy to 
carry on in the Special Administrative Region Government. Only 
a small proportion of them may, when the time comes, wish to 
leave the government. We hope these people will notify us two 
or three months in advance, as required by regulations. 
  As to the issue of the land fund, I feel this is also a pure 
misunderstanding. At the subgroup discussion of the PWC, we 
made it very clear that the reason we discussed the issue of the 
land fund is that we hope on 1 July 1997, without a day's delay, 
we can hand the land fund of over 100 billion [no currency 
specified as heard], or something like that, to the SAR 
Government in one lump sum without retaining a cent. But the 
question is which organization the land fund should go to. We 
discussed whether it should be the Foreign Exchange Fund or the 
Hong Kong Government's Financial Department. No matter what, 
the land fund will certainly be handed to the Special 
Administrative Region Government. If the Special Administrative 
Region Government, for a time, cannot decide how to take care of 
this fund, it may temporarily retain the structure of the 
existing commission for managing the land fund. This is why I 
said it was a pure misunderstanding. [end recording] 
  [Yuan] The Sino-British row has continued to this day 
without showing any signs of improvement. When will Lu Ping 
come again? Has Chris Patten considered the possibility of the 
British side extending a formal invitation to Lu Ping? 
  [Begin recording] [Patten] Well, that is something we will 
have to look at, whether or not it is sensible to make another 
formal suggestion to Director Lu. I think he knows perfectly 
well that as far as we are concerned, whenever he would like a 
meeting, we would be very happy to have one. 
  [Lu] Now we do not have the basis. First, you must go 
through these channels, including the channel of the PWC, and 
the two sides start communication and create some prospect of a 
solution through negotiation. Then the two of us can have a 
talk on the basis of this and this is the only way we can 
possibly work out some solution. If we go ahead and meet each 
other while nothing has settled into shape, it will be all 
empty. The two of us cannot possibly discuss many detailed 
issues. Only when the detailed issues have been solved at the 
more preliminary levels can we expect some solution from our 
meeting. 
  [Patten] I very much hope that Director Lu will have had a 
very good week in Hong Kong, will have seen what progress we 
have made in the last couple of years since he has been able to 
be here, will have seen that despite what was said at the recent 
PWC meeting, there is not much sign of social turmoil here in 
Hong Kong. I hope he will have had an enjoyable stay and I hope 
it will have encouraged him to come back many times before 30 
June 1997. We would very much like to see him and I hope that 
each time he comes, he will be able to broaden the number of 
people that he actually sees and communicates with.
