William Clinton showed intelligence and promise from childhood.  An
overachiever at school, his home life was punctuated with long
discussions on a variety of subjects including desegregation and
social justice.

After graduation he went on to Georgetown, Oxford (as a Rhodes
Scholar) and Yale Law School.

His college career was threatened by the Vietnam War, but he arranged
deferments until induction seemed unlikely, then drew a high lottery
number, avoiding military service.  This incident drew criticism
during subsequent political campaigns.

Returning home, he ran successfully for governor in 1978 at age 32 but
was defeated for reelection.  Older and wiser, he ran successfully
three more times, making improvements in education, the economy and
welfare.

He and his wife, Hillary, invested in a real estate venture,
Whitewater, and the related failure of a savings and loan.  The
scandal simmered for years.

In the presidential campaign of 1992 he defended his record in
Arkansas and his personal and draft history.

A German editorial summarizes Clinton's early presidency.  Despite
some blunders, a year later he enjoys a 60% popularity rating; the
economy is up, prices stable and interest and the deficit are
down. </SUM>
