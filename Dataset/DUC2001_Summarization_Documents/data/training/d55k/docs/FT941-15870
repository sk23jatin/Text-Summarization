erosion of credibility

While President Bill Clinton has been quaffing Pilsner with Czech President
Vaclav Havel in Europe, controversy over his investments in Arkansas in the
1980s has continued to ferment, threatening to damage his credit with the US
public.
The controversy is over whether a bankrupt Arkansas savings and loan
organisation used its funds to prop up Mr and Mrs Clinton's investments in
an Ozark mountain property venture known as Whitewater or to pay Mr
Clinton's campaign debts from his 1984 race for the state governorship.
Mr and Mrs Clinton made the Dollars 68,900 investment in 1978, in
partnership with Mr James McDougal, owner of Madison Guaranty, an Arkansas
savings and loan entity. The Clintons say they lost all their money.
Republican critics want an investigation of whether Mr Clinton as governor
intervened to delay the shutdown of Madison, which failed in 1989 at a cost
to taxpayers of around Dollars 50m. They also want to examine suggestions
that Madison money was improperly channelled to Whitewater and to Mr
Clinton's 1984 campaign fund.
Mr McDougal denies that the Clintons benefited in any way from his handling
of Madison, and notes that he was acquitted in 1990 of fraud charges brought
by a Republican-appointed prosecutor.
Adding to interest in the case, the Clintons' Whitewater files were handled
by Mr Vincent Foster, the deputy White House counsel who committed suicide
last year.
Despite the intense Republican pressure, neither the Whitewater controversy
nor allegations last month by two Arkansas state troopers about Mr Clinton's
sex life as governor appear to have damaged his popularity.
A Washington Post-ABC poll published yesterday showed that 59 per cent of
those questioned approved of the job Mr Clinton is doing as president, with
36 per cent disapproving - a rather better rating than the same survey's
finding in December, before both sets of allegations boiled over.
Another poll published by USA Today and CNN showed Mr Clinton's approval
rating holding steady at 54 per cent, and 72 per cent said Whitewater had
had no effect on their opinion.
Nevertheless, White House advisers fear a steady erosion of Mr Clinton's
credibility, with both polls showing a decline in the number of people
believing in his honesty and integrity.
The White House strategy for dealing with the Whitewater charges, which were
also raised during the 1992 presidential election campaign, had been to
stonewall. As Mr Clinton put it: 'I didn't do anything wrong. I made an
investment and lost money. I then spent more money to document that we'd
lost money. All the federal investigators in the world that have looked into
this, not a single soul has alleged that I've done anything wrong.'
The White House and attorney-general Janet Reno had tried to deflect calls
for the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the matter, arguing
that anyone she named would be viewed as no more independent from her than
the career justice department official now in charge of the investigation.
But the move became inevitable after nine Democratic senators joined a
chorus of Republicans in urging the president to ask for a special counsel.
Mr Clinton said in a television interview in Prague that he had given all
the information he had to the Justice Department, but 'then people said
'Well, that's not enough' . . . So I think we have to evaluate that and see
where we are.'
Besides reccommending that he ask Ms Reno to appoint an independent counsel
some White House officials are understood to be urging Mr Clinton to make
public all the documents he has handed over to the justice department.
Because they were the object of a subpoena, the documents are currently
secret.
Ms Reno would have to name the counsel herself, since the law passed in the
wake of the Watergate scandal 20 years ago providing for a special counsel
to be named by a judicial panel lapsed last year.
Whatever Mr Clinton does, he can scarcely win. Keeping the Whitewater
documents sealed fuels his political enemies and feeds speculation that he
might have something to hide. Publishing them will just create a flurry of
further news reports.
But with senior members of his own party, such as Senators Pat Moynihan and
Bill Bradley, urging him to ask for a special counsel, Mr Clinton can no
longer complain that the furore is just partisan politics - an argument that
has carried less weight all along because the Republican attack has been led
by the eminently moderate Congressman Jim Leach of Iowa, rather than the
party's more rabid tub-thumpers.
