   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton secured a
solid majority to win his sixth straight Democratic nomination. But,
like a boxing champion who slipped by on points, he is being asked
to explain the lack of a knockout punch.
   Clinton, 43, was the nation's youngest governor when first
elected in 1978 and he has had a stranglehold on the state's
Democratic Party ever since.
   But in last week's primary, he garnered just 55 percent of the
vote while Tom McRae, an unpolished campaigner who heads a public
policy think tank, earned 39 percent. Four also-rans divided the
rest.
   Clinton, who toyed with the idea of running for the presidency in
1988 and already is talking about 1996, said he saw no cause for
concern in the margin of his primary victory.
   ``I didn't see how I could get 60 percent, knowing the number of
people who were saying in the surveys that they thought I was a good
governor but were concerned about the tenure issue,'' Clinton said
recently.
   Tenure was summed up repeatedly by McRae as ``10 years is long
enough.''
   Arkansans grow bored with their politicians sooner than voters
elsewhere, Clinton said, in part because politics in the state is so
personal. Pumping hands at shopping malls and crawfish festivals is
considered as important as running the right television ad.
   ``I'm just trying to tell people that in business they wouldn't
fire a 43-year-old with 10 years of experience who's doing a good
job,'' Clinton said days before the primary.
   Sheffield Nelson, who upset Rep. Tommy Robinson for the
Republican gubernatorial nomination, already is jumping on the
theme, saying ``Arkansas is ready for a change.''
   Clinton, who has focused on improving the state's education
system, counters by calling himself the candidate of change.
   ``Frankly, if you look at what I proposed, compared with the
others, it represents more change,'' he said. ``Ten years is an
asset, not a liability.''
   Clinton lost his first re-election bid in 1980 to Republican
Frank White, but won again in 1982, 1984 and 1986, when the
gubernatorial term was changed to four years. He has all but
promised not to run for the White House in 1992 if re-elected this
year.
   His showing in this year's primary, largely in line with
pre-election polls, was the first time since his political comeback
in 1982 that Clinton got less than 60 percent of the primary vote.
   ``I'm sure the governor would like to have made a better showing,
but when you're in office 10 years you have a lot of friends and a
lot of enemies,'' said Bill Paschall, a Little Rock political
consultant. ``I don't think it's a death blow that he made 55
(percent), but it shows him he has to work harder.''
   While the biggest complaint against Clinton appears to be that he
has been in office too long, the governor also has been accused of
being more interested in his national ambitions than state concerns.
   Clinton's recent troubles with the legislature also have been a
sticking point. Twice in 1989 he failed to win legislative approval
for proposals to increase taxes.
   Nelson, who hopes to paint Clinton as a tax-and-spend Democrat,
said the primary election results show the governor is on the ropes.
   ``I'd say against an unknown who never held an office, I think
that was low. It probably did make some bells go off in his head,''
Nelson said.
   Clinton said he would have done better if a large number of
traditional Democrats hadn't crossed over to the GOP primary to vote
against Robinson.
   ``We did poorly in areas where I did not campaign; where my
supporters, in spite of my best interest, believed the polls and
didn't work; and where we did a poor job of telling the people what
I had done that affected their lives; and where people knew there
was an alternative but didn't know much about what the alternative
was,'' Clinton said.
   Betsey Wright, Clinton's former chief of staff, said the
governor's supporters were complacent.
   ``Bill Clinton is always perceived as being so strong that people
find it difficult to believe in calls for such cohesion and tight
energies,'' she said of the primary.
