GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas was gambling yesterday that an
extraordinary prime-time television confession of 'wrongdoing' in his
marriage has salvaged his campaign for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
During a joint TV appearance with his wife, Hillary, Mr Clinton admitted his
marriage had been rocky, but he denied allegations of a 12-year-long affair
with a former Arkansas state employee and part-time cabaret singer.
Ms Gennifer Flowers, the employee, last night held a news conference in New
York in which she accused Mr Clinton of lying when he claimed they were just
friends. She said: 'I was Bill Clinton's lover for 12 years. . . he is
absolutely lying. I'm disappointed, but realistically I never thought he'd
come out and admit it.'
In response to one question, she said the local Republican party in Arkansas
had offered her money six months ago to reveal her affair with Mr Clinton,
but she had refused. She said she had lied to the press to protect him and
that later she sold her story to a supermarket tabloid because he had
angered her.
At the press conference Ms Flowers played 10 minutes of tape-recorded
telephone conversation she said was between her and Mr Clinton. Published
excerpts of these tapes have so far proved inconclusive and questions have
surfaced about her credibility.
Ms Flowers maintains she met Mr Clinton in 1979 and 1980 at the Excelsior
Hotel in Little Rock. But the hotel did not open until 1982. She also claims
to have reported on Mr Clinton while working with a local TV station, but
Little Rock's KARK-TV said it could find no tapes to support this.
Mr Clinton, the early front-runner for the Democratic nomination, was judged
yesterday to have taken a huge gamble by appearing on CBS's programme 'Sixty
Minutes', which generally attracts more than 30m viewers.
Although his campaign advisers said the sex scandal rumours were drowning
out the Arkansas governor's message to voters, the risk was his confessions
could draw further media scrutiny just three weeks before the critical New
Hampshire primary election.
Mr Clinton, 46, appeared calm and good-humoured throughout the interview. 'I
have acknowledged causing pain in my marriage,' he said. 'I have said things
to you tonight and to the American people from the beginning that no
American politician ever has.' But in response to a question on whether he
had ever committed adultery, Mr Clinton avoided a clear-cut response. 'I'm
not prepared to say tonight that any married couple should ever discuss that
with anyone but themselves.'
He appealed to the US public for fairness and urged the media to respect his
privacy, instead of turning the 1992 campaign into a 'game of gotcha'.
Mr Clinton saw his popularity fall sharply last week among likely Democratic
voters in New Hampshire, Reuter reports from Boston.
In a poll by the American Research Group, which has conducted daily surveys
in advance of the February 18 primary, support for Mr Clinton fell 14
percentage points in five days last week.
The latest polling data put Mr Clinton in second place, with 25 per cent, to
Mr Paul Tsongas, a former Massachusetts senator, who has 27 per cent of
voters' support.
