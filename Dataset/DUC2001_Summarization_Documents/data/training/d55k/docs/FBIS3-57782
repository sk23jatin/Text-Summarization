<F P=106> [Editorial by Kurt Kister: "Clinton's Astonishing Comeback"] </F>
  [Text] On 20 January 1993, Bill Clinton swore his oath of 
office. One month afterwards, renowned commentators declared 
the administration to be a premature birth without any marked 
prospects for survival. Already, during the first week, the 
newly installed President had caused a storm with his 
ill-considered attempt to lift the ban against homosexuals in 
the U.S. Army. Then one blow followed after the other: 
Candidates for important offices were rejected; strong words on 
Haiti and Bosnia during the election campaign were not followed 
by the promised deeds; the new team in the White House was 
extremely clumsy. The man, whom almost two-thirds of all 
Americans trusted -- even though only 43 percent had voted for 
him -- seemed to flounder like a leaking ship. 
  How times change! Today Bill Clinton is a President who has 
managed to achieve the most important thing within 12 months: 
America feels better again. Hardly any other master in the 
White House after 1945 has caused as many things to move in as 
many fields as Clinton. In this he is similar to -- and this 
makes conservatives complain -- Ronald Reagan, the great 
changer. And even more: He is popular. After Clinton's 
popularity rates rose and fell like a roller-coaster, they have 
now almost reached the level of 20 January again. About 60 
percent attest that he is doing good work. One-fifth even 
declare Clinton to be the person they admire most -- far ahead 
of family members or other authorities. 
  What are the successes? First of all, there is the economy. 
For 1994, a growth rate like the one in 1988 is predicted, 
which is better than for a long time. Prices are stable, the 
people have confidence in their future and spend more money, on 
consumer goods and investments. At Christmas, business 
purchases with credit cards rose by 25 percent -- an unambiguous 
sign that the people incur debts, because they are confident 
that they will be able to pay them. Because confidence is 
higher and interest rates are still low, more Americans are 
buying houses and cars. This creates satisfaction and 
stimulates economic development. 
  Critics claim that all this is a success Clinton has been 
given for free; the economy would have recovered with or without 
Clinton. The opposite cannot be proved, but it is a fact that 
the economic climate has clearly improved since the narrow vote 
in favor of Clinton's budget and has not deteriorated as the 
Republicans predicted pessimistically. Another important sign 
is that the annual budget deficit will go down. While, in 1992, 
Bush's economists predicted a deficit of about $300 billion for 
1994, now it seems that the deficit will go down to about $200 
billion in 1994. This is due to the recovery of the economy, 
but also to Clinton's thrift measures. Bill Clinton does what 
Reagan and Bush only promised: The deficit really goes down. 
The debts and the economy were the most important topics of the 
election campaign. Clinton has not disappointed his voters. 
  This range of topics also includes the North American Free 
Trade Agreement, NAFTA, and the world trade agreement GATT. 
With great skill, Clinton brought together a coalition of 
Republicans and Democrats, who pushed the controversial NAFTA 
treaty through Congress. Even though the president had to 
primarily struggle against his own party, he turned out to be a 
politician with leadership power, who enforces principles, if 
necessary also against his friends. Regarding the GATT 
conclusion, the Americans under Clinton and chief negotiator 
Kantor also acted skillfully and, in the end, correctly. A 
pleasant side effect of the NAFTA affair was that the charlatan 
Ross Perot was deflated -- above all by Al Gore, the most 
influential vice president of the recent past. 
  There are still a number of other things, for instance a new 
weapons law, which Bush and Reagan always blocked; a security 
package, which will bring, among other things, 100,000 
additional policemen to the streets of the cities; a law that 
permits young people to work their university loans off through 
some kind of alternative national service. And the Clintons, 
with First Lady Hillary at the head, have started the struggle 
for a general health insurance. If this struggle were to show 
success in 1994, this could become a piece of reform that can be 
compared only with the introduction of compulsory social 
insurance more than 50 years ago. 
  And what about foreign policy? Everyone knows the traps in 
Somalia, Haiti, North Korea, Bosnia, and Russia. Clinton's men 
sometimes stumbled, also because they were so inexperienced in 
international matters. However, the team is consolidating 
itself. The change in the Pentagon is one sign of that; Strobe 
Talbott's appointment as Warren Christopher's deputy is another. 
Europe must get used to the fact that this administration no 
longer claims superiority in all issues, that it defines 
national interest more narrowly and is, therefore, more careful 
with interventions -- political and military ones. One must 
never forget: Bill Clinton has been elected because he is 
supposed to reestablish America's trust in itself. This is the 
yardstick by which the President and his voters measure success 
or failure.
