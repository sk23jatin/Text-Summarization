John Sununu, Governor of New Hampshire, took control of the campaign
of George H.W. Bush in the Republican primary there in 1988 and led
Bush to an impressive victory. When President Bush named Sununu as
White House Chief of Staff his brusque combative style quickly
alienated members of congress, cabinet members and White House
staff. Many questioned whether he could survive in this critical
position.

Sununu added to his personality problems with an insensitivity to
certain ethical standards, particularly use of government planes and
vehicles for private and political travel. Although President Bush
belittled Sununu's indiscretions as "appearance problems," he was
clearly embarrassed by the publicity. Sununu made things worse by
ridiculing his critics. By June of 1991 a poll showed a 41% negative
rating for Sununu compared to just 20% the previous October.

With the re-election campaign nearing, pressure for the dismissal of
Sununu grew in the summer of 1991. Bush was reluctant to dismiss his
loyal supporter and Sununu was determined to stay, even after the
president's son, George W., told him that he had become a
liability. When Sununu pressed the President for his support he found
it was not forthcoming and submitted his resignation bitterly
complaining of betrayal.  </SUM>
