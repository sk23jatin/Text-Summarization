President George H.W. Bush remained loyal to his Chief of Staff, John
Sununu, long after most of official Washington was alienated by the
brusque combative style and officious rude manners of the White House
gatekeeper. After all, had it not been for Sununu's effective
leadership of the Bush campaign in the New Hampshire Republican
primary in 1988, George H.W. might never have been
president. Nevertheless, as George H.W.'s re-election campaign
approached, pressure to get rid of Sununu increased. The Bush family
prevailed upon Sununu to submit his resignation which he did in
December 1991 under protest.  </SUM>
