<TEXT>     Sununu submitted his resignation, effective Dec. 15, in a five-page
handwritten letter to Bush as they flew to Florida for a speech at a juice
factory Tuesday.;   The former New Hampshire governor, ending weeks of
speculation and criticism of his performance, told Bush in the letter he
"would never want to not be contributing positively, much less be a drag on
your success.";   In thinly veiled comments, Sununu made it clear that he felt
betrayed because, in many ways, he was doing exactly what Bush had hired him
to do.;   The departing chief of staff was also obliquely reminding the
president that this was not a matter of principle, but of ratings; his
bullying tactics had been fine as long as the opinion polls did not go down.; 
 "I assure you that in pit-bull mode or pussycat mode (your choice, as
always), I am ready to help," Sununu wrote.;   His reference was sardonic. He
had called himself "a pussycat" and kept a plush cat on top of the bookcase in
his large West Wing office. But, at close range, it was clear that the toy
animal was really a tiger, and that is exactly how Sununu saw himself.;   As
he stated his credo in his first month in Washington: "I don't care if people
hate me, as long as they hate me for the right reasons.";   Bush and Sununu
formed a close bond during the 1988 campaign, in the snows of New Hampshire,
when Bush saw his presidential dream slipping away after a humiliating showing
in Iowa.;   "Whatever they did in Iowa, they will not reject George Bush in
New Hampshire," Sununu vowed, as he dragged Bush down from his elite perch to
start what he called a "see me, touch me, feel me" campaign among the people.;
  But it was Sununu who embodied the barbed-wire side of Bush's politics; in
many critical ways, he was an accurate reflection of the way Bush believed
things should work.;   During the 1988 campaign, Bush conceded in interviews
that he had to do some of the dirty work in attacking Dukakis; his alternating
nice and nasty faces came to be known as "George the Gentle" and "George the
Ripper.";   But as president, Bush preferred to farm out to aides the duties
of bully and gunslinger.;   By making the abrasive former governor of New
Hampshire his chief of staff, Bush hoped that he could keep a certain balance
of rough and smooth in his governing and in his politics.;   In the many times
over the past three years when Sununu helped land the president in the
political soup, the Washington political cognoscenti speculated that Bush was
keeping his chief of staff only out of loyalty to Sununu for helping him win
the New Hampshire primary, or because Bush was too nice to fire anyone, or
because he was too indecisive.;   The truth is more complicated, and Sununu
put his finger on it Tuesday. While Sununu's lack of political skill in
dealing with political Washington eventually cost him his job, and while his
fatal flaw may have been in believing that he was smarter than Bush, the chief
of staff was -- often in an inept way -- trying to fulfill the mandate he had
been given by his boss.;   In many critical ways, Sununu exacerbated Bush's
limitations, rather than making up for them, and whenever the spotlight swung
away from foreign affairs, it became painfully apparent that this was a White
House without a long-range agenda, without a communications strategy and
without first-rate thinkers in many top jobs.;   As Bush tried to be the
ultimate Washington insider, the chief of staff alienated Congress, Cabinet
members, House Republicans and the press, who disdained Sununu because they
believed he misled them. Sununu even tried to manipulate his boss on occasion,
with the effect that Bush looked weak and waffling.;   When the glow faded
from the Persian Gulf war, and the country began looking to the White House
for leadership on the stagnant economy and the pain of many Americans, the
president once again allowed himself to be guided by Sununu and his closest
White House ally, Richard Darman, the budget chief.;   Sununu and Darman urged
the president to follow his instincts that there was nothing he could do about
the economy and that he should not even try to come up with a drastic plan.;  
Moreover, in the recent fiasco about caps on credit card interest rates,
Sununu did something that is never done in a city that operates strictly on
hierarchy: He blamed the mess on his boss, going on national television to say
Bush had "ad-libbed" the idea in a speech.;   Bush appeared out of sync with
the country. His approval ratings began dropping again. Important Republicans
scorned by Sununu began going on the record with their advice to Bush that he
was being ill served by his chief of staff.;   And finally and most important,
the president's wife, Barbara, and oldest son, George, turned on Sununu.;  
And so, finally, Bush invited Sununu to resign.;   In accepting Sununu's
letter of resignation, Bush said he regretted but supported Sununu's "good
decision." He said his aide would remain on at the White House until March 1
as a presidential counselor with Cabinet rank.;    Now Bush must find another
chief of staff, and another hired hatchet. But this time, his friends say, he
will look for aides who can play those roles while also playing by the rules
of the Washington game.;   While sources said Transportation Secretary Sam
Skinner headed the list of candidates, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said today he did not believe Bush had made the offer to Skinner.;   Others
said to be in the running were Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who was chief of
staff under President Ford; former GOP Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota; and
former New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean, a strong Bush loyalist who now is
president of Drew University.  </TEXT>
