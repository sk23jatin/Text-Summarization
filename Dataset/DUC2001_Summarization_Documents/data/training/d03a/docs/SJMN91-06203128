<LEADPARA>  HE WAS Washington's "Abominable No-Man," the White House chief of staff who,
according to Time magazine, "refuses to waste a second, even for such
amenities as 'hello and goodbye.' ";    He was a former two-term New Hampshire
governor who daily greeted aides with an abrupt, "What are you doing for your
country."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     According to one writer, "He said no to cabinet secretaries and to
congressmen, to journalists and to job-hunters; he said no short and sharp
without troubling to be polite about it; and so he would come to be warmly
detested on the Hill, in the National Press Club, at Republican National
Headquarters and across the country." And his improprieties, when they were
revealed, shocked the nation and rocked the administration to its very
foundations. And he wasn't even named John Sununu.;    But the rise and fall
of Sherman Adams, President Eisenhower's powerful chief-of-staff, is more than
an interesting political doppleganger to the travails of his lineal heir, John
Sununu. The case of Sherman Adams sheds an eerie light on Sununu's rise in the
ancient, stony soil of New Hampshire politics. It gives us a grip on the
origins of the presidential chief of staff, an unofficial position that has
come to be a virtual American prime ministership. And the course of Sherman
Adams' humiliation may even allow us a perspective on the course of John
Sununu's struggle for survival and possibly even a way to predict the timing
of his ultimate demise.;    That Sherman Adams, the first "assistant
president" and John Sununu, conceivably the last of the imperial chiefs of
staff, were both catapulted from governor of the Granite state into national
prominence is not at all coincidental. Rather it stems from the strange
configuration of American politics and New Hampshire's place in it. With its
"first-in-the-nation" primary, New Hampshire has historically exerted a pull
far in excess of a population still only marginally larger than the city of
Detroit.;    Sherman Adams had risen in New Hampshire politics of the '30s and
'40s because of his organizational abilities and the perception of his
incorruptibility.;    After graduating from Dartmouth, Adams worked as a
logging camp supervisor and eventually rose to become an executive in one of
New Hampshire's leading timber companies. In 1940, at the behest of his
employers, he ran for a seat in the New Hampshire House, eventually becoming
governor in 1949.;    When he took office, Adams began a program of
streamlining and reducing state government that provided a model followed
three decades later for another new New Hampshire governor, John Sununu.;   
In late 1951, New Hampshire was the launching pad for the campaign of Dwight
D. Eisenhower.;    Eisenhower, with Adams' support, defeated the isolationist
Sen. Robert Taft in the New Hampshire primary. But Eisenhower and Taft ran
neck and neck in subsequent state tests and arrived at the Republican
Convention in Chicago virtually tied. It was then that Eisenhower's top
lieutenants came to Adams and asked him to become their candidate's floor
manager.;    The 1952 Republican convention was the last national convention
to go beyond one ballot. And when Eisenhower did win, he asked Sherman Adams
to become his personal campaign manager.;    Bush's campaign debt;    In a
very similar way, three and a half decades later, George Bush paid off a very
major campaign debt by appointing Sununu chief of staff. Without Sununu, the
chances are very good that the current president of the United States would
not be named George Bush.;    In February 1988, a reeling Bush campaign limped
into New Hampshire after finishing a near-fatal third in the Iowa caucus. But
the savvy Sununu, evidencing some of the high arrogance for which he has
become justly famous, was not at all downcast. "Isn't it great," he reportedly
told a puzzled friend about the news in Iowa. "Don't you see how much good I'm
going to do for the next president of the United States?";    And true to his
words, Sununu crafted an attack campaign that painted Bush's chief rival, Bob
Dole, as a closet "tax and spend" liberal. That ploy, plus a computerized
get-out-the-vote campaign, crafted by Sununu on his own spreadsheet program,
did the trick, and the rest is history.;    Unlike Sherman Adams, John Sununu
could not be mistaken for a rock-ribbed Granite Stater. Born in Havana, Cuba,
the son of an immigrant Lebanese trader and a Greek mother from El Salvador,
the stubby, rumpled Sununu liked to refer to himself as a "universal ethnic.";
   Three degrees from MIT;    But an upper middle-class New York upbringing, a
brilliant career at military school and three degrees from MIT put the reputed
180 I.Q. Sununu on the fast track. In the early '60s, he began building a
solid career running the several engineering firms he founded and also became
a professor of physics at Tufts University.;    Sununu was elected to the New
Hampshire Assembly in 1972, and 10 years later became governor of New
Hampshire on a conservative campaign theme of nuclear power, increased
business and no new taxes.;    It was a propitious era to be governor of New
Hampshire. The state was coming out of the '82 recession and beginning a
six-year boom that pumped enough revenue into the coffers to build a new state
hospital and prison and still have money left over to give state employees
raises. According to Concord Monitor editor Mike Pride, "Sununu did well; he
fell into an easy time to be governor.";    Sununu was re-elected twice and
gained a reputation as an activist governor.;    He also developed a
propensity for the excesses that would prove so costly in Washington.
Eschewing the mansion in Concord, Sununu chose to live an hour away from the
capitol and be chauffeured to and from every day. The Wall Street Journal
noted that Sununu "became an extremely powerful figure in a state where the
powers of governor are not great.";    More or less the same thing could have
been said about Sherman Adams when he gave up the New Hampshire governorship
to become Dwight Eisenhower's "assistant president" in 1953.;    The reason
for Adams' enormous power lay in the nature of the Eisenhower presidency.
Continuing the staff system that had proven itself during the war, Adams noted
that "Eisenhower simply expected me to manage a staff that would boil down,
simplify and expedite the urgent business that had to be brought to his
attention." It also meant that Adams would decide who and what crossed the
president's threshold. This power as the presidential gatekeeper has
characterized the chief-of-staff position ever since.;    Adams managed to
keep the Eisenhower administration on a more or less even keel through the
worst of the McCarthy outrages, through Eisenhower's heart attack in 1955, the
Suez crises in 1956, the Little Rock school integration crimes in 1957 and the
invasion of Lebanon in 1958.;    According to Eisenhower, Adams was successful
because "From our first meeting in 1952, Sherman Adams seemed to me best
described as laconic, abrupt, businesslike and puritanically honest." Adams
was the shining example that Republicans could hold up that they had done
something about their 1952 campaign slogan to "clean up the mess in
Washington.";    Thus, the spring 1958 revelations that Adams had for years
enjoyed free hotel accommodations and accepted the now legendary vicuna coat
and an expensive rug from an unsavory New England industrialist named Bernard
Goldfine, while at the same time interceding with regulatory agencies on
Goldfine's behalf, came as a major shock.;    Adams waged a vigorous and
seemingly successful defense before a congressional committee, asserting that
his worse crime had been "a mistake of judgment, not of intent.";    And there
things stood throughout the summer of 1958, with a somewhat tarnished Adams
carrying out the role he had defined over the previous six years. When pressed
about Adams, the president insisted that he was his "right-hand man . . . the
only man who really understands what I am trying to do." And when really
pressed about why he kept Adams on, Eisenhower wailed at a press conference,
"I need him.";    In 1958, an Eisenhower administration without Sherman Adams
was unthinkable. Certainly more unthinkable than a Bush administration without
John Sununu. But as the summer of '58 progressed, it became clear that Adams
was becoming an issue that could help the Democrats. So when, in September
1958, Republicans were badly beaten in elections in Maine, and campaign
contributions began to dry up, the pressure on Eisenhower to do something grew
enormous. But Eisenhower refused to personally fire his aide. Instead, he
delegated Vice President Nixon and the chair of the Republican Party to visit
Adams.;    Ever the good soldier, Adams finally listened, and in late
September quit. The gesture was largely futile. The year 1958 was the
beginning of the Democratic renaissance that led to the election of John
Kennedy in 1960.;    Today, as Vice President Dan Quayle could tell you, John
Sununu is no Sherman Adams. Sununu is as brash as Adams was self-effacing and
far more self-serving than Adams at his vicuna-coat worst. Nevertheless, the
continuing flap over Sununu's excesses and arrogance seem to mirror a
transgenerational anger at a public official who flaunted the Washington
establishment, who has made too many enemies trying too hard, and enjoying too
much, being the bad cop to the president's good.;    And even if a
controversial Supreme Court nomination has temporarily taken the spotlight off
of Sununu, the current chief of staff ought to ponder well next year's coming
election. He might question if his strange, parochial antics may just provide
the kind of ammunition in 1992 that the similarly alien behavior of Sherman
Adams did 34 years before. Ammunition that his own party will use to get rid
of him in time for an upcoming election if not before. (box)  </TEXT>
