<LEADPARA>  White House Chief of Staff John Sununu was marching down a hall next to the
Senate chamber last fall when he encountered Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady
walking in the opposite direction, trailed by a couple of reporters.;    Not
even pausing, Sununu barked at Brady to turn around and follow him. The tall,
patrician Brady stood stiffly in silence for a moment, obviously irked at
being addressed like a junior staff member, as Sununu continued walking
without waiting for a response.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "No, no, John," Brady called out. "YOU'RE going the wrong way." Reproached,
Sununu reversed tracks and followed the Cabinet secretary.;    These days,
Sununu seems to be making a habit of going the wrong way: The latest flap is
over his taking a chauffeur-driven White House car to New York to attend a
stamp auction.;    And the abrasive chief of staff is discovering that the
dozens of people he has insulted or slighted -- from administration officials
to members of Congress -- are watching his travails with thinly disguised
relish.;    Before, Sununu could take comfort in unswerving support from the
person who mattered: President Bush. But now, that too is in doubt.;    Bush
gave Sununu a less-than-ringing endorsement Wednesday, telling reporters that
the former New Hampshire governor has created an "appearance problem.";    And
suddenly, the political community is abuzz with questions about how long
Sununu will last in his job and how someone so bright could get himself in so
much trouble.;    Sununu's latest problems stem from his use of his official
car to go to New York for a stamp auction. There was nothing illegal about the
trip, or Sununu's ride home on a corporate jet after attending a GOP
fund-raiser in New Jersey later that night.;    But the incident raises
questions about Sununu's judgment because it came only a few weeks after
reports of his use of government jets for personal and political purposes.;   
Besides triggering a spate of unflattering attention, those reports prompted a
new, more-restrictive White House travel policy that required Sununu to get
advance approval for his flights.;    The latest flap has dominated White
House briefings the past two days and prompted Bush to suggest Wednesday that
Sununu shouldn't use his government car for such purposes again.;    "I
recognize, and I think the governor (Sununu) does, there's an appearance
problem," said Bush, who nonetheless defended Sununu's use of the car as
permissible in this case and said Sununu's job was safe.;    White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, amplifying Bush's comments, made it clear that
Bush had told Sununu that he was concerned by the appearance of impropriety
and that he wanted his chief of staff to take no more embarrassing trips.;   
Fitzwater said Bush expects such use of a White House car to be "a
one-time-only thing. . . . We only expect it to happen once.";    The
controversy is unquestionably an embarrassment for Bush, who has prided
himself on setting a high ethical standard for his administration. And some
former White House officials say Sununu should recognize that he is not
serving Bush well.;    "In light of his problems with his jet travel and all
that, he ought to be a little careful," said Lyn Nofziger, a White House
political director under Ronald Reagan. "If not for his sake, then for the
sake of the president. It's the president who has to run for re-election next
year, not John Sununu.";    As Sununu himself has noted, some of the criticism
goes with the job of saying "no" to administration officials and lawmakers who
want the president's ear.;    "Somebody has to be the tougher hand, the firmer
hand. It goes with the territory," Sununu said last month.;    But critics
complain that Sununu's brusque style has alienated Republicans and Democrats
needlessly, causing unnecessary ill will.;    He publicly dismissed Sen. Trent
Lott, R-Miss., as an "insignificant figure" last year during the budget debate
on Capitol Hill. He has enraged House Republicans by dressing them down
privately and questioning their political skills.  </TEXT>
