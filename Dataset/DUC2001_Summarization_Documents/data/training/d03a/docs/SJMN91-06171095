<LEADPARA>  President Bush was described as "upset, angry and perplexed" about use of a
government limousine by White House Chief of Staff John Sununu, who left his
latest controversy behind Tuesday night and flew to Iowa aboard a corporate
plane for a GOP fund-raising event.; But today the president came to the
defense of his embattled chief of staff.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Sununu created an "appearance problem" by using a government car to travel
to a New York stamp show, Bush said, but "given the circumstances, I think it
was appropriate.";    He added, however: "It doesn't set a precedent. It
doesn't say anyone that has access to a car can go anyplace that anyone wants
at any time.";    "I recognize, and I think the governor does, there's an
appearance problem," Bush said.;    But, he added, "The facts surrounding this
particular trip, this beating that he's taken, is unwarranted in my view."; In
Des Moines, Sununu vowed he would not take advice from "self-styled experts"
on how or when he travels.;    "You can't get here without traveling," Sununu
told a Republican fund-raiser. "I know that's a very complicated concept for
some.";    Sources said Tuesday that an angry Bush contacted a senior
political adviser Sunday to discuss how to handle the controversy after
learning of Sununu's decision to have a government car and driver take him to
New York last Wednesday. Sununu attended a rare-stamp auction and conducted
other personal business but no official duties there, officials said.;    Bush
apparently made his call after Sununu defended himself on television Sunday.
It was Sununu's first appearance on a network program since revelations in
April about his extensive use of government planes for activities ranging from
visiting his dentist to skiing to trips to his home state of New Hampshire.;  
 On Sunday, Sununu gave the same explanation for using the government car that
he had offered for using government planes -- that he must be able to
communicate instantly with the White House in the interest of national
security.;    Sununu has been unable to fly on government planes for personal
business since Bush instituted new travel rules after the April controversy.; 
  Sununu since has asked sponsors of political events at which he is to speak
to obtain corporate jets to take him to and from Washington. White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday that direct solicitation of firms to
provide such planes would not be improper, although Sununu aides deny that he
asked directly for the planes.;    The car controversy has created new ripples
among Republicans who question whether Sununu recognizes that repeated
questions about his ethics reflect poorly on Bush, who vowed during his
campaign to bring a higher ethical standard to his administration and fight
even the appearance of impropriety among aides.;    One administration source,
echoing comments by many Republicans outside the administration, said Tuesday
that Sununu "has a total blind spot on the issue of ethics and public
service.";    While Fitzwater has defended the legality of using the car and
corporate jets, he would not offer an opinion on perceptions of impropriety.; 
  "I can't make a judgment," he said, adding, "I don't know what happened" in
connection with the jets. Party officials in three states where Sununu has
made recent appearances said they, not the White House, asked corporations to
provide him planes.;    Sununu and Edward Rogers, his top personal aide, flew
to Des Moines Tuesday night on a corporate jet arranged by the Iowa Republican
Party so Sununu could address a fund-raising event, according to Randy
Enwright, the party's executive director.;    "Because of all the flak, we
wanted to make sure we did it right," he said. "We ran this by the White House
to make sure the company didn't have any business pending there.";    The
Kirke-Van Orsdel insurance company in Des Moines furnished the plane, Enwright
said, and the state party was to pay the firm about $2,000, the cost of two
round-trip, first-class commercial tickets.;    The New Jersey Republican
Party arranged last week for Beneficial Corp. of Peapack, N.J., to charter a
plane to fly Sununu here after a fund-raising appearance there, according to
party spokesman Bill Ulrey.;    After his personal business in New York last
Wednesday, Sununu had gone on to New Jersey for the fund-raiser, while his
driver returned alone to Washington. Beneficial had been prepared to fly
Sununu to and from the event, but Sununu changed his mind and took the car at
the last minute, officials said.;    White House officials said the local
press has raised the transportation issue on every Sununu trip since April,
reflecting how the controversy has played nationally. "Who's paying to get him
there is the first question they ask," an administration official said of
Sununu's travels.  </TEXT>
