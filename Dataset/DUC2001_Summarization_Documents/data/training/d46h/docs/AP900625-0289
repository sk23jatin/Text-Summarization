<HEAD>Southern Natural Gas Co. Agrees to Pay $300 Million for ARCO
Explosion</HEAD>

   Southern Natural Gas Co. has agreed to
pay ARCO Oil and Gas Co. more than $300 million for damages that
resulted from an explosion on an ARCO drilling platform in the Gulf
of Mexico last year.
   The March 19, 1989, blast and resulting fire killed seven
people, injured 23 and destroyed the platform. The blast occurred
while workers for Southern Natural Gas were attempting to make
repairs on the platform.
   Representatives agreed on the settlement Monday during a recess
in a civil trial that began June 11 in State District Court in
Madison County.
   They presented the agreement to Judge Bill McAdams while he was
holding court in neighboring Grimes County.
   ``We feel we've been adequately compensated for our losses,''
said Don Riddle, lead counsel for ARCO.
   ``Aside from Pennzoil, it's the largest settlement around as far
as anybody knows,'' Riddle told the Bryan-College Station Eagle.
   Pennzoil Co. in 1984 won a $10.3 billion judgment against Texaco
Inc. after claiming that Texaco had broken up its deal to buy Getty
Oil Co. Texaco agreed to settle the case for $3 billion in 1988.
   Houston attorney Randy Wilson, one of about 20 attorneys
representing Southern Natural Gas, declined to comment on the
settlement.
   According to the settlement, Southern Natural Gas made no
admission of guilt but agreed to pay ARCO $300.5 million by Aug. 6,
and to pay a total of $500,000 to three ARCO employees injured in
the explosion.
   ARCO was a party to several lawsuits pending against Southern
Natural Gas in federal court in Louisiana. The settlement will end
those suits, Riddle said.
   The settlement will be paid by the gas company's insurance
carriers, primarily Lloyd's of London, Riddle said.
   ARCO had asked for between $250 million and $325 million in
actual damages and $5 billion in exemplary damages resulting from
the explosion on a drilling platform about five miles south of the
mouth of the Mississippi River.
   In addition to damage to the platform itself, ARCO claimed it
lost about $200 million in profits from oil and natural gas sales
because the destroyed platform was crucial to a seven-platform oil
field.
   Southern Natural Gas bought natural gas from ARCO and
transported it to shore by means of pipeline running from the
platform. The explosion occurred when subcontractors hired by the
gas company cut into the pipeline while trying to make repairs.
