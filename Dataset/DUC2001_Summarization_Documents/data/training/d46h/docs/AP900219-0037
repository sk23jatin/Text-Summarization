   Motel guests jumped out of windows and
lowered themselves to the ground using bedsheets to escape fire
from an explosion apparently caused by a natural-gas leak that
killed four and injured 10.
   A night desk clerk was investigating reports of a gas leak at
the 62-unit Super 8 Motel when the explosion occurred early Sunday,
officials said.
   ``I had just gotten up to go to the bathroom and had come back
and my wife said, `Don't you smell the gas?''' said Neal Woodrick,
60, of Trenton, N.J. ``And then it happened.''
   ``It sounded just like a bomb had gone off _ boom,'' said his
wife, Joan Woodrick, 58.
   Fire officials were to comb the charred remains of the motel
today for clues to the explosion.
   All of the 45 to 50 guests were believed to be accounted for,
authorities said.
   Firefighters used a crane, pitch forks and shovels to sift
through piles of charred mattresses, carpet, pink insulation and
dry wall left from the fire and explosion, which threw debris as
far as 300 feet from the building.
   ``I'm almost positive it was a natural gas explosion,''
Hagerstown Fire Chief Gary Hawbaker said. ``The whole front of the
building _ first, second and third floors _ was blown out. That
whole chunk was engulfed.''
   Hawbaker said there was a natural gas line in the middle of the
fire, ``so we couldn't put out the rest of the fire until the gas
was shut off.'' It took firefighters about 30 minutes to shut off
the gas, he said.
   Joan Ganje-Fischer, a spokeswoman for Super 8 Motels Inc. of
Aberdeen, S.D., said that after a guest told the clerk that gas was
leaking from the laundry room area, the gas company told the clerk
to try to turn the gas off.
   ``He was right in the center of the explosion when it
happened,'' she said. ``He came back to the front desk and his hair
was on fire. He put his hair out with a towel, pulled the alarm
notifying the guests, called 911 and then began evacuating the
motel.''
   Donald Lee, 39, of Shorewood, Wis., said he awoke, put on pants,
a shirt and a coat and jumped 12-15 feet out of a second-story
window, breaking his wrist in the fall.
   ``I heard screaming and glass breaking,'' he said. ``A number of
people saw flames. A family had their hair singed.''
   Some guests were moved to a motel across the street, and the Red
Cross provided food, clothing and shelter.
   The dead were identified as James G. Scharnek, 34, of Milwaukee,
Wis.; Kristoddie Brown, 25, of Capital Heights; Mercedes Keyes, 26,
of Hagerstown; and Margretta E. Parker, 70, of Richmond, Va.
   Ten people were treated at Washington County Hospital for smoke
inhalation and minor injuries and were released, spokesman John
Costopoulos said.
