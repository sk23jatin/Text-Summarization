   An explosion in a 12-unit, three-story apartment
building less than a mile from Parliament killed a man on Thursday
and injured three people, sending rubble flying a full block away.
   Police believed the explosion was caused either by natural gas or
propane.
   Witnesses said they smelled gas immediately after the blast at
about 9:30 a.m., but there was no confirmation the explosion was
caused by a gas leak.
   Two hours after the explosion, firefighters rescued a middle-age
woman trapped inside her apartment. She was taken to a hospital.
   Three other people were taken to the Ottawa Civic Hospital
earlier. One man, not identified, was pronounced dead on arrival.
   A dog brought in by police searched for more possible victims.
   Flying debris damaged cars and nearby downtown buildings.
   Bill Maxwell, the landlord of two nearby buildings, said the
explosion sent ``huge chunks of concrete, the size of television
sets'' hurtling through the air.
   Cab driver Steve Legault was returning to his nearby apartment
when he heard the blast. As he ran toward the building, he
encountered a dazed and bleeding woman.
   ``She was delirious and was crying that her 7-year-old son was
still in the apartment.''
   Legault said he ran into the building and saw a man lying halfway
out of a doorway in a pool of blood.
   ``He was covered with blood and his head had deep cuts in it. I
checked and I think he was dead.''
   John Kalina, 36, who lives one block north, said the explosion
``sounded like someone was kicking our door in.''
   The building is in a fashionable neighborhood of renovated older
homes, townhouses, boutiques and restaurants.
