<HEAD>Couple Gets $11.5 Million Award For Natural Gas Explosion</HEAD>

   Illinois Power Co. has agreed to pay
$11.5 million to a couple critically injured in a natural-gas
explosion in their home two years ago.
   In a settlement reached Monday, the utility company agreed to pay
Jerry Sickmeier, 33, and Lisa Jines, 26, $10 million in damages and
$1.5 million for medical expenses, said the couple's attorney, C.E.
Heiligenstein.
   Both sustained burns on over 80 percent of their bodies in the
Dec. 7, 1986, explosion at their home in Cahokia, a St. Louis
suburb. They now live in nearby Belleville.
   The settlement was reached on the day a trial in the case was
scheduled to begin.
   ``They are much relieved that this financial ordeal is over with
and that they can have some lifetime financial security,''
Heiligenstein said. ``Both suffered severe burns and have severe
limitations in the limbs.''
   Heiligenstein said neither has worked since the explosion.
   Illinois Power spokeswoman Barbara Lillyman said the utility had
no comment on the settlement.
   The couple alleged that Illinois Power was negligent when it
allowed a natural-gas pipe to deteriorate to the point that it
ruptured. Gas from the pipe traveled through sewer lines into the
home's utility room and was ignited by the pilot light of a
hot-water heater, they said. The explosion occurred as police were
awakening area residents and telling them to evacuate.
   Sickmeier was treated for seven months at Massachusetts General
Hospital in Boston for third-degree burns that covered most of his
body. He also suffered burns in his lungs and spent more than two
months on a respirator.
