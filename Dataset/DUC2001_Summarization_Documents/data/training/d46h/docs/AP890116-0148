   Natural gas explosions that leveled two
homes and damaged a third in two days were called a coincidence by
utility officials, but some residents remain unconvinced.
   Northern Illinois Gas Co. crews reported finding nothing unusual
Monday while scouring more than 100 homes and a school within a mile
radius of the explosions Thursday and Saturday in this town of
17,000 about 60 miles northwest of Chicago.
   ``It's just a coincidence. No relationship exists between the two
explosions,'' said utility spokesman Bob Edwards.
   There were no serious injuries, but some residents remain uneasy.
   ``I was really, really upset. I couldn't sleep last night,'' said
Angela Carparelli, who lives in the neighborhood.
   One house was leveled following an explosion on Thursday and more
explosions on Saturday destroyed one house and knocked another off
its foundation.
   Fire Chief Richard Nebel said it will probably take investigators
weeks to determine the causes of the blasts.
   ``The leaks we know of have been stopped,'' Nebel said late
Monday. ``We are taking test bores and no leaks or vapors have been
found today.''
   Jerry and Becky Rentschler, whose home was destroyed Saturday,
said they almost left their youngest children _ Shelly, 13, and
Matthew, 11 _ home while they went away for the weekend. They
changed their minds at the last minute.
   ``I saw aluminum siding flying through the air and all of a
sudden there was this big flame,'' said 12-year-old Lisa Bernau, who
saw the Rentschlers' house explode. ``It was so scary.''
   Minutes after another neighbor went outside to see what happened,
the neighbor's house was blasted from its foundation, said Nebel.
   On Thursday, James Steurer, 79, was sitting on his bed tying his
shoes when a gas explosion leveled his house and sent him and the
mattress flying into the driveway. He suffered only cuts and
scratches, noting ``absolutely, I'm lucky.''
   In addition to being two days apart, the explosions were at sites
about six blocks apart and in houses fed by two separate gas lines,
Nebel said.
   Government and utility officials insist there is no need for
residents to worry.
   ``It's one of those rare things of Mother Nature or the man
above,'' said investigator Terry Pitkus of the state fire marshal's
office.
