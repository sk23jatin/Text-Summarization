   The only remaining U.S. manufacturer of a
crucial space shuttle fuel component announced a halt in production
until it can be shown the factory is safe after explosions leveled
another plant last week.
   Kerr-McGee Corp. made Thursday's announcement in the face of
state pressure.
   Later in the day, the demolished plant's operator said a leaking
natural gas line was responsible for the series of earthquake-force
blasts May 4, which killed two people, injured 326 and did an
estimated $73 million in damage.
   The report by Pacific Engineering and Production Co. was
challenged by Southwest Gas Corp., which said the line ruptured
after the explosions, not before.
   Kerr-McGee said it would suspend production of ammonium
perchlorate, an oxidizer for solid fuel used in the space shuttle
and military rockets, until an independent inspection shows the
plant is safe.
   Paul Gaines, the company's director of governmental relations,
said he hoped production could resume within a few days.
   ``A prolonged shutdown is not helpful to any of us,'' Gaines
said.
   He said the company has already contracted with a safety
consultant to study the plant, and the inspection could begin by
Monday. Gaines said the plant will continue making other chemicals.
   Gov. Richard Bryan announced the shutdown after company
officials agreed late Thursday morning to the halt. Bryan said
``legal work was being prepared'' to force Kerr-McGee to suspend
production before it agreed to the shutdown.
   Local and state officials had expressed outrage when the plant
resumed production Tuesday of ammonium perchlorate, particularly
since last week plant officials said they would wait until
authorities determined the cause of the blast before reopening.
   Kerr-McGee and Pacific were the only two plants in the country
to manufacture ammonium perchlorate, and National Aeronautics and
Space Administration officials have said the explosion could delay
the space shuttle program..
   Pacfic Engineering Chairman Fred Gibson said Thursday that a
large natural gas line passing through the plant had been leaking
for at least 30 minutes before the first fire broke out at his
company's plant.
   ``The massive gas leak is believed to have saturated the earth
below the paved surfaces of the ... plant and to have ignited at
the point of origin as a result of circumstances unrelated to
(plant) operations,'' Gibson said.
   ``All of the subsequent destructive events were caused by the
gas leak, the gas fire and the gas explosion,'' he said.
   Southwest Gas spokesman Dennis Hetherington disputed the report.
   ``As far as we're concerned, our facilities are a victim of the
explosion and not the cause,'' Hetherington said.
   Fire Chief Roy Parrish said the fire department would withhold
judgment until it completes its own investigation.
