   A natural gas explosion rocked an apartment
complex at an Army base, killing a 5-year-old girl and injuring 17
residents and rescuers, authorities said.
   The girl's remains were discovered in the rubble of the building
at 9:30 a.m. today, about 12 hours after it blew up, officials at
Fort Benjamin Harrison said.
   The blast occurred hours after fire authorities arrived to
investigate a gas leak at another building in the complex. That
building was being evacuated when the blast hit several hundred
feet away, authorities said.
   The explosion, in a housing area for enlisted personnel,
destroyed a four-family housing unit and damaged another unit, said
post spokesman Maj. Ronald Downing.
   ``The fire engines were trying to get in and we were trying to
get out. It was total chaos,'' said Joan Adams, a resident of the
complex. She described people running through streets in their
pajamas, carrying children.
   At least 17 residents and firefighters were injured. By midday
today, three people were still listed in critical condition, one of
them a 4-year-old girl, authorities said.
   Marion County Deputy Coroner Charles W. Green said he could not
conclusively identify the dead child until after dental records
were checked. But base officials said there was little doubt it was
the 5-year-old girl who had been reported missing earlier.
   Firefighters and police called off their search through the
smoldering rubble after the body was found. The girl's identity was
not released. Other members of her family were among the injured,
Downing said.
   The post on the edge of town serves as a processing center for
soldiers en route to the Persian Gulf, although none of those
soldiers stayed in the affected area.
   Fire authorities had been called in about 5:45 p.m., or 3{ hours
before the blast, after people reported smelling gas, Downing said.
He said officials had planned to evacuate the 240-unit Harrison
Village complex before the explosion.
   Harley said authorities turned the gas off at one housing unit
where they thought the leak was occurring. But a nearby unit, where
the gas had not been turned off, blew up, he said.
   Some residents complained that they were not adequately warned.
   Adams, whose husband is a sergeant, said that about two hours
before the explosion, military police began telling residents that
a gas leak had been found elsewhere in the complex and would be
fixed.
   ``He told us there was no danger for us to stay there,'' she
said. Her family had planned to leave anyway, because the complex
was without heat and hot water, but the explosion happened before
they did so, she said.
   Lt. Col. Bill Carey, provost marshal, said the building where
the leak was detected was evacuated as a precaution, but ``we
didn't feel the whole area needed to be evacuated.''
   However, the blast occurred in another building about 800 to
1,000 feet away, he said, adding that ``prior to the explosion, we
had not been to this building.''
   The blast was felt more than two miles away. Wood and other
debris were scattered where a two-story building once stood. Rubble
was strewn over four blocks. About 210 families were evacuated
after the explosion.
   ``Insulation was coming down like snow when we got here. One
apartment was engulfed in flames and the other building was in
flames,'' said State Trooper Anthony Blackburn.
