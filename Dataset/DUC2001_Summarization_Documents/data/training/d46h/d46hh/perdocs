Earthquake-force blasts on May 4th leveled a Nevada Kerr-McGee plant
that makes ammonium perchlorate, a component of space shuttle and
military rocket fuel. Two people were killed, 326 injured, and an
estimated $73 million in damage done. The plant says a pre-explosion
30-minute leak in a large natural gas line passing through the plant
ignited at the point of origin from circumstances unrelated to plant
operations. Southwest Gas said the line ruptured after the
explosions. The plant is the sole US manufacturer of ammonium
perchlorate. The state ordered production halted while the explosion
is investigated, which could delay the space shuttle program.  </SUM>

Jerry Sickmeier and Lisa Jines were critically injured in a
natural-gas explosion in their suburban St. Louis home Dec 7,
1986. Both sustained burns on 80% of their bodies and haven't worked
since the explosion. They alleged Illinois Power was negligent in
allowing a natural-gas pipe to deteriorate until it ruptured. Gas from
the pipe traveled through sewer lines into the home's utility room and
was ignited by the hot-water heater pilot light. The explosion
occurred as police were awakening and evacuating area
residents. Illinois Power agreed the day the trial was to begin to pay
the couple $11.5 million.  </SUM>

A natural gas explosion leveled a house Thursday, and explosions six
blocks away on Saturday leveled a second house and knocked a
neighboring one off its foundation, in a town 60 miles northwest of
Chicago. The sites were fed by two separate gas lines and Northern
Illinois Gas calls the explosions coincidences. Crews found nothing
unusual at 100 homes and a school within a mile radius of the
explosions. The blasts' causes may not be known for weeks. No serious
injuries resulted. In Thursday's explosion, a man's mattress carried
him to safety when it was sent flying into the driveway.  </SUM>

An explosion Thursday in a 12-unit, three-story Ottawa apartment
building in a fashionable renovated area less than a mile from the
Canadian Parliament killed a man and injured three people. Rubble,
including concrete chunks the size of TVs, was sent flying as much as
a full block away and damaged cars and nearby downtown buildings.
Police believe the cause was either natural gas or propane. Witnesses
smelled gas immediately after the 9:30 AM blast. Two hours after the
blast, firefighters rescued a middle-aged woman trapped inside her
apartment. A dog brought in by police searched for other possible
victims.  </SUM>

At the world's largest solar power plant near Barstow, an explosion
occurred Wednesday as third and fourth natural gas-fired oil heaters
were being brought on line. One of the heaters, used to back up the
solar heating system, exploded as a result of equipment malfunction
and set fire to a second, which also exploded. Two plant workers
suffered minor breathing problems. Fire and plant officials disagreed
on whether smoke from the burning oil was carcinogenic. The Harper
Lake plant is operated by LUZ International, which operates 8 such
plants in the California desert and had a fire at another solar plant
two years ago.  </SUM>

A natural-gas leak caused an explosion early Sunday at a three-story
Super 8 Motel in Hagerstown. A guest told the night clerk gas was
leaking from the laundry room area.  The gas company told the clerk to
turn the gas off, which he was attempting when the explosion
occurred. He pulled the alarm and called 911. Guests jumped from
windows and lowered themselves using bedsheets. Four were killed and
ten treated for smoke inhalation and minor injuries. The explosion
threw debris 300 feet and blew out the building's front. The fire
couldn't be put out until the gas line was shut off.  </SUM>

A natural gas well 75 miles SE of Jackson, Mississippi exploded at
about 2pm Tuesday, killing one worker and critically burning four
others. Authorities first evacuated people within a half-mile but
expanded to two miles for fear winds would scatter poisonous hydrogen
sulfide gas, which is naturally associated with some gas
fields. Officials intended to use a flame thrower to keep the escaping
gas burning in order to burn off the poison. Experts at capping gas
wells were to fly in Tuesday night. The gas rig, owned by R&H Oil and
Gas of Tickfaw, LA, was known as Travis No. 3.  </SUM>

Southern Natural Gas has agreed to pay ARCO Oil and Gas more than $300
million for damages resulting from an explosion March 19, 1989 on an
ARCO drilling platform in the Gulf of Mexico. The blast and resulting
fire occurred when subcontractors hired by SNG tried to make repairs
and cut into the pipeline that transported gas to shore. Seven people
were killed and 23 injured, and the platform was destroyed. SNG, which
bought gas from ARCO, made no admission of guilt but agreed to pay
$300.5 million and a total of $500,000 to three ARCO employees injured
in the blast.  </SUM>

A natural gas explosion rocked an apartment complex for enlisted
personnel at Fort Benjamin Harrison Army base, killing a 5-year old
girl and injuring 17 residents and rescuers. Three people were still
listed in critical condition. Fire authorities were called in about
5:45pm, 3 hours before the blast, after people reported smelling
gas. The gas was turned off at the housing unit where the leak was
thought to be, but while that building was being evacuated, a unit
800-1000 feet away, where the gas had not been turned off, blew
up. The blast destroyed one four-family unit and damaged
another. </SUM>
