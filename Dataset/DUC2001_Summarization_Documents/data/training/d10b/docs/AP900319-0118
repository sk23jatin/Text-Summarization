<HEAD>One-time Nominee for High Court Argues Case Before Justices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert H. Bork, who once hoped for a Supreme
Court seat, instead stood before the nation's highest court Monday.
   He was there in the capacity of a lawyer _ apparently making him
the first defeated Supreme Court nominee ever to argue before the
justices.
   Representing Citibank in a big-stakes battle, Bork argued that
U.S. banks with branch offices overseas should not be required to
pay depositors after foreign governments seize or freeze those
accounts.
   The Senate rejected Bork's nomination to the high court in 1987
after a bitter political battle. He was branded a conservative
extremist by opponents.
   Bork, nominated by then-President Reagan, has said he was the
victim of a campaign of lies and distortions led by liberals.
   There were no references to that fight Monday as Bork engaged in
debate with the justices and opposing lawyers over the complexities
of federal banking law and related matters.
   Bork was treated much the same as any attorney who appears
before the justices. They questioned him vigorously, occasionally
interrupting him for clarification and elaboration.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who occupies the seat that eluded
Bork, directed a few questions at Bork.
   Bork, 63, a former federal appeals court judge, is a fellow at
the American Enterprise Institute and will begin teaching
constitutional law in the fall at the George Mason University law
school in Arlington, Va.
   He will be paid $25,000 a year to teach one course each semester
as a part-time professor.
   Bork was only the sixth man this century to be denied a Supreme
Court seat by the Senate and the 26th in its history.
