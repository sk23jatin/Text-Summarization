Robert Bork, a conservative thinker and Judge, was nominated by
President Regan to replace the retiring Justice Powell on the Supreme
Court.  His nomination was controversial, strongly contested and then
defeated by liberal constituencies, lead by Senator Edward Kennedy of
Massachusetts.

His critics claimed that he was a sexist, a racist, a judicial
extremist and a threat to the republic.  His supporters claim he was
rejected because he opposes judicial activism.  He believes in
sticking strictly with legal principle rather than what is "good" or
"moral" or "right" within current activists' social, economic or
criminal-justice agendas.

He now teaches, lectures and writes.  </SUM>
