<TEXT>     Keating's four-month Superior Court trial ended in guilty verdicts on
Wednesday, his 68th birthday. The jury found him guilty on 17 of 18 counts of
duping investors about the safety of junk bonds sold through Lincoln
branches.;   The land developer and financier, who donated $1.3 million to the
"Keating Five" senators and paid colossal salaries to relatives, never
flinched as the verdicts were read.;   Keating contends vindictive regulators
hounded him out of business. His lawyer said he would appeal the conviction.; 
 The victims were among thousands of bondholders who lost $250 million when
Irvine-based Lincoln collapsed, the costliest thrift failure in history with a
bailout tab to taxpayers of $2.6 billion.;   Many elderly investors said they
were told Keating's bonds were safe, like insured certificates of deposit.;  
"We couldn't bring their money back, but we brought them a measure of
justice," said lead prosecutor William Hodgman.;   Jeri Mellon, the leader of
a bondholders support group, shouted "Justice! Justice!" after the verdict was
read.;   She said the group would now turn its efforts to a seemingly odd
goal: delaying the federal criminal case against Keating.;   Mellon said the
bondholders want a civil lawsuit in Tucson federal court heard before a
federal criminal case. The reason is simple: The civil action holds the
promise of recovering their losses from lawyers and accountants accused of
propping up Keating's crumbling empire.;   "A lot of our members are in their
80s and 90s," Mellon said. "We're talking to legislators, anybody who'll
listen, insisting that the (criminal) case be postponed.;   "We can't wait
another 2 1/2 years until they get to our trial.";   Several lawyers involved
in the Keating legal wars told the Associated Press that a federal indictment,
of Keating and probably four others, would be returned this month. Attorneys,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the indictment could come as early as
Dec. 12.;   A Los Angeles federal grand jury has spent more than two years
investigating Keating, his family and officers and directors of Lincoln and
its parent company, Phoenix's American Continental Corp. Keating was American
Continental's chairman and chief executive.;   Four former associates have
pleaded guilty to federal crimes and are cooperating with prosecutors in hopes
of light sentences.;   The federal prosecutors in Los Angeles, Alice Hill and
David Sklansky, declined to comment on when an indictment might come, as did
Justice Department spokesman Doug Tillett in Washington.;   However, the topic
surfaced publicly Wednesday as prosecutor Hodgman and defense attorney Stephen
C. Neal addressed Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito, who set sentencing for
Feb. 7 and rejected a Hodgman request to raise Keating's bail from $100,000 to
$1 million.;   "As Mr. Neal has indicated, there is the possibility of some
imminent action on the federal front," Hodgman said in arguing that Keating
was now an increased flight risk.;   Emotions ran high during the trial, which
became a national window into the extravagances and duplicity that contributed
to the collapse of the savings and loan industry during the freewheeling
1980s.;   Civil lawsuits contend that after buying Lincoln in 1984, American
Continental quickly and illegally began siphoning off federally insured
deposits to fund a playground of lofty salaries and company-paid jet-setting
for Keating, his family and top officers.;   During the trial, bondholders
jeered Keating as he passed them in court hallways. An elderly woman who lost
$4,900 on a junk bond gave him a shaking, demanding repayment. A comic swatted
him with a powdered wig, shouting, "This is for America.";   In addition to
the action to recover bondholder losses, the Tucson suit includes a $2.7
billion racketeering suit by the Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency
that inherits failed thrifts.;   Other actions include an effort by the Office
of Thrift Supervision to recover $131 million allegedly looted from Lincoln by
Keating and his cronies, and an investigation by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.;   At the trial, defense attorney Neal gambled by calling no
defense witnesses, saying prosecutors never showed Keating took part in or
even knew about any deceptions of bond buyers at Lincoln's Southern California
branches.;   Neal told jurors an innocent verdict would rebuke the regulators
Keating accuses of driving him into insolvency.;   But Joseph Cotchett, the
attorney for the bondholders in the civil suit, said the jurors sent another
message instead.;   "It's a tribute to the system, because the Keatings of the
world can buy a lot of people, including politicians. But they can't buy a
jury," Cotchett said.; WHO'S DOING TIME IN THE S&amp;L DEBACLE; Here are the
