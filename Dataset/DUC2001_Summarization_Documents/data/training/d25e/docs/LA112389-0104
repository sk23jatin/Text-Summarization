</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan owner Charles H. Keating Jr., his family and his 
business empire poured nearly $350,000 into state politics during 1985 and 
1986, with about half of it going to Gov. George Deukmejian's reelection 
campaign, contribution records show. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the $173,000 donated to Deukmejian's campaign, Keating's family and 
business connections also contributed $176,500 over the two years to Democratic 
and Republican groups and such politicians as then-Assembly Republican Leader 
Pat Nolan of Glendale and Gray Davis in his successful race for state 
controller. 
</P>
<P>
The figures do not include at least $83,336 in contributions made personally or 
through the firms of two other Keating associates -- Los Angeles attorney Karl 
M. Samuelian and San Diego businessman Tom C. Stickel. 
</P>
<P>
Keating hired Samuelian, the governor's chief fund raiser, to be one of his 
California attorneys. He also invested heavily in a San Diego company 
controlled by Stickel, who also was a Deukmejian fund raiser and became the 
Republican Party's finance co-chairman in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"Charlie Keating's political reach, in retrospect, was phenomenal," Stickel 
said in a recent interview about Keating's political muscle. 
</P>
<P>
The political largess in Sacramento was part of a web of influence that the 
blunt-talking Arizona businessman wove throughout the country to nurture and 
protect his ill-fated financial and investment companies, which regulators now 
contend inflated the value of their assets and deceived investors into buying 
high-risk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
In April, Keating's American Continental Corp. of Phoenix filed for bankruptcy, 
prompting federal officials to immediately take over its subsidiary Lincoln 
Savings &amp; Loan. The move is expected to cost taxpayers $2 billion -- the 
costliest savings and loan bailout in American history. 
</P>
<P>
After the seizure, the outspoken Keating candidly declared that he had expected 
the political contributions to prod influential politicians, such as U.S. Sen. 
Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), to fend off hostile regulators. 
</P>
<P>
"One question, among the many raised in recent weeks, had to do with whether my 
financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my 
cause," said Keating. "I want to say in the most forceful way I can, I 
certainly hope so." 
</P>
<P>
In California, Keating hired key Deukmejian supporters or appointees to help 
protect his ill-fated Lincoln Savings. As attorneys, he hired fund raiser 
Samuelian and Franklin Tom, a former state commissioner of savings and loan who 
left public service to join Samuelian's Los Angeles law firm. The lawyers 
helped Keating obtain state permission to float more than $200 million in 
high-risk bonds, on which his company subsequently defaulted. 
</P>
<P>
Keating also paid $200,000 in 1985 for the consulting services of former 
Savings and Loan Commissioner Lawrence W. Taggart, who had left government 
service in December, 1984, for a job with TCS Enterprises of San Diego. Days 
before he left for TCS, Taggart approved a request by Lincoln to increase the 
amount of assets the institution could sink into high-risk real estate 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1985, when Taggart joined TCS, Keating hired him as an executive 
and paid $2.89 million to buy 19.2% of the fledgling San Diego firm's stock as 
it went public. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Keating and his associates were investing heavily in California 
state politics. His coalition of contributors included his family -- son 
Charles Keating III and three sons-in-law -- and his corporations, including 
American Continental, Lincoln Savings and three other subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
The group also included eight employees and executives, such as American 
Continental Vice President Robert J. Kielty and consultant Taggart, as well as 
Phoenix business associate Conley Wolfs-winkel, who bought 6,150 acres in 
Tucson with American Continental in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
While Keating himself gave only $7,000 -- all of it to Deukmejian -- the 
coalition of his relatives, business interests and associates brought total 
donations to $349,500 in 1985 and 1986. Reports show: 
</P>
<P>
* Deukmejian received $173,000 from the Arizona businessman and his associates. 
The governor received $80,000 directly from American Continental and Lincoln 
Savings; $19,000 from Keating and his family members; $51,000 from other 
American Continental subsidiaries and executives; and $23,000 from Keating 
business associates. 
</P>
<P>
The governor has said that he met Keating only once and never knew of Lincoln's 
financial woes until he read about them in newspaper reports this year. 
</P>
<P>
* Keating and associates gave $176,500 to other state political organizations 
and politicians. They gave $7,500 to the California Republican Party, $50,000 
to the League of Conservative Voters, $17,000 to then-Assemblyman Davis' 
campaign for state controller, and $85,000 to the state Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
They also gave $17,000 to four legislators -- Nolan, who authored the law 
deregulating the savings and loan industry in 1982; Assembly Rules Committee 
Chairman Tom Bane (D-Van Nuys); Assemblyman Bruce Bronzan (D-Fresno), and 
Assemblyman Dennis Brown (R-Los Alamitos). 
</P>
<P>
* Stickel and TCS contributed $50,666 in money, staff time and office space to 
Deukmejian and the Republican Party. Samuelian and his law partners gave 
$32,700. 
</P>
<P>
EARLY WARNING -- A key federal regulator told top government officials nearly a 
year before the collapse of Lincoln S&amp;L that their efforts to control the 
Irvine thrift would be unsuccessful. D1
