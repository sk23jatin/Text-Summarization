<P>
A lobbyist for former Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan owner Charles H. Keating Jr. 
said Friday that moments after he first met Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) at a 
political event in 1984, the senator suggested Keating should contribute to his 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
James Grogan also told the Senate Ethics Committee he remembers more than one 
occasion on which Cranston or his aides sought contributions from Keating while 
at the same time promising to assist Lincoln in its battle against federal 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston has acknowledged only one such conversation. 
</P>
<P>
Grogan, a surprise witness who testified under a limited grant of immunity from 
prosecution, said there was never a trade-off between Keating's contributions 
and his request for assistance. But he appeared to strengthen the committee's 
case against both Cranston and Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.). He provided 
important new details of Cranston's close alliance with Keating and 
contradicted earlier testimony by Cranston aides Joy Jacobson and Carolyn D. 
Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
The panel is investigating charges that Cranston, Riegle and three others -- 
Sens. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), John McCain (R-Ariz.) and John Glenn (D-Ohio) 
-- improperly assisted Keating in exchange for contributions. Their 
intervention with federal regulators allegedly delayed the government takeover 
of Lincoln, contributing to losses of $2 billion by the federally insured 
thrift. 
</P>
<P>
Grogan, 36, who was paid $300,000 a year to lobby for Lincoln, recalled that he 
introduced himself to Cranston at an event in 1984, explaining that he worked 
for an Arizona builder who had just purchased a savings and loan in California. 
</P>
<P>
He said Cranston promptly pulled a 3x5 card from his pocket, saying: "I've been 
very good to the savings and loans. I've worked hard for California savings and 
loans. You all should really support me." 
</P>
<P>
Cranston then wrote Grogan's name and telephone number on the card, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A short time later, according to Grogan, he received a telephone call from 
Jacobson, the senator's fund-raiser. He said she repeated Cranston's contention 
that he had been "very supportive" of California thrifts and asked him if 
Keating would raise money for the senator. 
</P>
<P>
Grogan indicated he was surprised by this aggressive appeal for money because 
Keating is a conservative Republican who opposes abortion, and Cranston is a 
liberal Democrat who is an abortion rights advocate. As a result, he said, he 
did not immediately commit Keating to anything during his first conversation 
with Jacobson. 
</P>
<P>
He said he later persuaded Keating to assist Cranston by telling him that the 
senator shared his negative opinion of then-Federal Home Loan Bank Board 
Chairman Edwin J. Gray. Keating disagreed with Gray's policies and later 
accused the bank board chairman of carrying on a "vendetta" against Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1985, as a result of Cranston's appeal for funds, Keating collected 
$15,000 in checks from his employees for the California senator. It was the 
first of nearly $1 million that Cranston solicited from Keating -- $60,000 for 
his campaigns, $85,000 for the California Democratic Party and $850,000 for 
voter registration groups founded by the senator. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Grogan emphasized that Keating did not always have Cranston's 
support for his proposals. He said contributions could buy him access to a 
senator, but the money provided no guarantee that the senator would do the 
bidding of a contributor. 
</P>
<P>
"For example," he told the committee, "Sen. Cranston, whom I believe we gave 
the most money to, there were several times specifically when I went to his 
office and asked him, on behalf of Mr. Keating, to take action. And he said, 
'No, I can't do it.' And this was after tremendous amounts of money had been 
raised for him." 
</P>
<P>
Grogan contradicted earlier testimony by Jacobson, who said that she -- not 
Cranston -- was approached at the 1984 Democratic National Convention by 
Grogan, who "offered to be helpful to the reelection campaign." 
</P>
<P>
He said that Keating, who eventually developed a warm friendship with Cranston, 
usually waited until the end of his meetings with the senator to discuss 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
As Grogan explained it: "Normally as we were leaving, either Mr. Keating would 
say, 'Is there any way I can help you, senator? I appreciate our relationship.' 
Or at times, Sen. Cranston would say, 'Could you help in this area, could you 
help raise money here, could you do that?' " 
</P>
<P>
He added: "There was never an occasion where Mr. Keating asked Sen. Cranston to 
do something, and Sen. Cranston said, 'Only if you raise funds for me.' There 
was never an occasion where Mr. Keating said, 'If you do this for me, I will 
raise X-amount of dollars for you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by special counsel Robert S. Bennett, Grogan detailed the 
following occasions on which he said Cranston or his aides allegedly sought 
contributions while at the same time pledging to assist Keating with 
regulators: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In late 1986, when the Senate was considering legislation that would have 
imposed restraints on Keating's management of Lincoln, Grogan tried to contact 
Jordan, Cranston's aide on the Banking Committee, for assistance in battling 
the proposal. Unable to reach Jordan, he instead talked to Jacobson. 
</P>
<P>
When Jacobson called back an hour later to report that she had told Jordan of 
Keating's opposition, she then said she wanted to "switch gears" and discuss 
something "totally unrelated." She asked him whether Cranston could get a 
personal loan for his reelection campaign from Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Cranston's campaign subsequently received a $300,000 line of 
credit from Lincoln that he never used. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In September, 1987, Grogan personally delivered two checks totaling 
$250,000 for voter registration to Cranston in his office in the Capitol. "Mr. 
Keating wanted me to give you those checks," he told the senator. 
</P>
<P>
Grogan and Cranston then discussed Lincoln's problems, with Keating joining the 
conversation over the office speaker phone. Keating asked Cranston to contact 
then-bank board Chairman M. Danny Wall on Lincoln's behalf, and the senator 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In January, 1988, Grogan, Keating, Cranston, Cranston's son, Kim, and Kim's 
then-girlfriend, actress Shelley Duvall, had dinner together at Jimmy's 
restaurant in Los Angeles. Kim explained the work of Cranston's voter 
registration groups, one of which he headed, and Cranston offered to make two 
telephone calls suggested by Keating. In one call, Cranston arranged a meeting 
for Keating with Wall. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston has previously acknowledged that both contributions and assistance for 
Lincoln were discussed at the dinner. Grogan could not remember any discussion 
of specific amounts of money that Keating would contribute to the voter 
registration effort. 
</P>
<P>
Grogan contradicted testimony by Jordan concerning a written statement she 
inserted into the Congressional Record on Cranston's behalf in 1987 that 
assisted Lincoln in a pending court suit against the bank board. Jordan told 
the committee she acted entirely on her own initiative, but Grogan said she was 
acting on his request. 
</P>
<P>
Grogan also contradicted Riegle's statement that he did not arrange meetings 
between the five senators and federal regulators in early April, 1987. These 
meetings have been a central focus of the so-called Keating Five case because 
the regulators alleged that they were asked improperly by the senators to go 
easy on Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
He said it was during Riegle's visit to Keating's headquarters in Phoenix in 
March, 1987, that the senator first proposed the idea of such meetings. He said 
he later learned that Riegle had contacted Gray, who consented to meet with the 
senators. 
</P>
<P>
Grogan said Riegle, who was in line to become chairman of the Senate Banking 
Committee, had also insisted he himself could not attend such a meeting with 
the regulators unless he was invited by McCain and DeConcini, who represented 
the state where Keating lived. 
</P>
<P>
"It was apparent to me . . . Sen. Riegle knew as a true politician that this 
was a potential politically explosive situation because there was so much media 
at the time about Mr. Keating and Mr. Gray fighting," he said.
