The file Duc2001testtraining.tar.gz was kindly provided by Terry
Copeck at the University of Ottawa for DUC 2002. 

It contains the usual two-level topic/document/ directory
organization.  Within each document directory are three files:
'<doc>.abs' and '<doc>.body' contain respectively the assessor's
summary and the document body (with none of the tagged data that lie
outside the body and that have come up in recent list discussion).  A
third '<doc>.txt' file contains a concatenation of abstract and body
prefixed by 'Abstract:' and 'Introduction:' headings (for systems that
want to take the document apart themselves).

All files are plain vanilla ASCII with DOS line endings (the HTML tags
were stripped out of the summaries on a PC).
