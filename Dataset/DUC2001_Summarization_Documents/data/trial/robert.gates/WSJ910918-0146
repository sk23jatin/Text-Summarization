   WASHINGTON -- Senate hearings on Robert Gates's nomination
to be director of the Central Intelligence Agency suggest
that an atmosphere of intimidation and internal jockeying in
the CIA influenced analysis related to the Iran-Contra
affair.
   Testimony released yesterday shows that a senior CIA
officer, who raised early warnings of improprieties, feared
putting his analysis in writing because of concern that the
accusations would be shown to the White House.

   "I was hesitant to allege in writing that White House
officials directing the project, including the national
security adviser, were engaged in highly questionable, if not
illegal, activities," said Charles Allen, explaining why he
crafted an October 1986 memorandum to play down evidence of
funds being diverted in the operation. "To put this in
writing . . . did not seem prudent."
   In later questioning, Mr. Gates himself acknowledged that,
even as the CIA's No. 2 man, he had been hesitant to
challenge the entrenched power of the agency's operations
division in this period.
   And while insisting he had welcomed alternative views as
an analyst, Mr. Gates disclosed he had successfully urged the
State Department to suppress objections to a 1985 report that
served to advance Director William Casey's early agenda in
the Iran-Contra affair.
   At issue was a CIA intelligence estimate that became part
of an effort to rethink U.S.-Iranian relations and to make
selective arms sales to Tehran. Though the document's
significance wasn't appreciated then by many, it was used by
Mr. Casey and others to lay the groundwork for the Iran
initiative. The late director sought to avoid dissent that
could raise obstacles for policy makers, so when analysts at
the State Department's intelligence bureau raised objections,
Mr. Gates telephoned Morton Abramowitz, then chief of the
intelligence bureau. Mr. Abramowitz, later U.S. ambassador to
Turkey, ultimately agreed not to press for a footnote despite
the continued dissent in his shop at the State Department.
   The revelations came as Mr. Gates completed his second day
of questioning before the Senate Intelligence Committee,
which is now expected to call him back next week for further
testimony after hearing related CIA and intelligence
witnesses tomorrow and Friday. Partisan skirmishing colored
the early exchanges yesterday. But behind solid, almost
unquestioning GOP support, the national security aide appears
confident of overriding Democratic critics and winning the
top job that eluded him once before in 1987.
   His poised, controlled style contrasts with frequent
memory lapses regarding Iran-Contra, and this record will be
judged against live testimony tomorrow from Alan Fiers, chief
of the CIA's Central American Task Force in the mid-1980s.
Mr. Fiers has acknowledged in federal court to knowing
details of the Contra supply network run from the White House
and financed by profits from the U.S. arms sales to Iran.
Questioning by senators yesterday was based in some cases on
information already provided by Mr. Fiers, and Mr. Gates was
forced back to the awkward position of saying he couldn't
recall key events.
   Among these was an October 1986 meeting in Mr. Casey's
office following the shooting down of a cargo plane carrying
supplies to the Contras inside Nicaragua. CIA documents
indicate that Mr. Gates was present at the evening session
also attended by Mr. Fiers, and Chairman David Boren twice
asked the nominee if he had any recollection of being told by
Mr. Fiers or a second CIA officer that the lost transport was
"Ollie's plane" -- a reference to Marine Lt. Col. Oliver
North, who oversaw the Contra supply operation.
   Mr. Gates said that he had no recollection of such a
remark or of the meeting more generally. Similarly, he said
that he had no memory of a conversation that summer that Mr.
Fiers has described as being related to a plan to have the
CIA buy millions in assets owned by Col. North's network. The
proposal had been advanced by President Reagan's national
security advisers, and senators said Mr. Fiers had told the
committee of receiving a call from Mr. Gates regarding the
plan long before the operation was disclosed publicly.
   In connection with current investigations into the Bank of
Credit &amp; Commerce International, Mr. Gates was more precise,
and his testimony sheds new light on the CIA's interaction
with banking regulators. Mr. Gates said that the CIA had long
had a "very awkward" relationship with the Federal Reserve
but that it had responded to specific requests by the
Treasury Department relevant to BCCI in the fall of 1984.
This request, Mr. Gates said, was what led to an early CIA
report in January 1985 that went to the Treasury and,
ultimately, to the Comptroller of the Currency's office. That
report included information describing BCCI's interest in
First American in Washington, according to previous
statements by CIA and other intelligence officials.
   In the post Cold War era, Mr. Gates's ambitions for the
CIA include a role in economic intelligence. But he sought to
narrow this agenda to two areas affecting business and trade
abroad. He indicated that intelligence assets abroad could be
used to gather information that would be useful to U.S.
negotiators seeking to establish a more "level playing field"
regarding subsidies and trade competition. And secondly, in
connection with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the CIA
could play a counter-espionage role to blunt efforts by
foreign intelligence services seeking to steal technology
from U.S. firms.
