The Iran-Contra scandal cast a shadow on the 1991 nomination of Robert
Gates to be Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Testimony by
Alan Fiers, former CIA Chief of Central American operations, about the
illegal diversion of funds caused many Democratic senators to question
Gates's claim to be unaware of these activities. Then some of Gates's
CIA associates accused him of tailoring intelligence assessments to
fit Director Casey's stubborn preconceptions, a charge hotly disputed
by Gates.

In the end Gates received solid support from Republican senators and
of Intelligence Committee chairman David Boren who, in turn, persuaded
other influential Democrats to back Gates. Gates was confirmed by a
64-31 roll-call vote.
