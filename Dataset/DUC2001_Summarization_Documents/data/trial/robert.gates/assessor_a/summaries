Central Intelligence Agency Director William Webster has resigned,
raising speculation as to his successor. Possible candidates include:
James Lilley, Ambassador to China; former intelligence official Bobby
Inman; and Senator Warren Rudman. The leading contender, however, is
Deputy National Security Advisor Robert Gates.

Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman David Boren (D., Okla.)
supports Gates as does Sen William Cohen (R., Maine). National
Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft is also expected to back Gates.

Although Webster has received high public praise he remains the target
of personal sniping related to the Intelligence Community's
performance during the Gulf War.

The nomination of Robert Gates to head the Central Intelligence Agency
has run into stiff opposition in the Senate after former CIA official
Alan Fiers conceded that he knew of the Iran- Contra diversion of
funds and relayed this knowledge to Clair George, an immediate
subordinate of Mr. Gates. This has caused some senators to question
the veracity of Mr. Gates who has said that he did not know of the
diversion.

The situation is further complicated by secret complaints to the
Intelligence committee from CIA antagonists of Mr. Gates and a news
report, denied by the White House and CIA, that Mr. Gates was involved
in an illegal arms deal with Iraq.

Senate hearings on the Gates nomination as Director of the Central
Intelligence Agency have been postponed until September pending
testimony from former CIA officials on the Iran- Contra
scandal. Chairman David Boren of the Senate Intelligence Committee
will seek a grant of immunity for Alan Fiers. A subpoena was
authorized for Clair George, the CIA's former deputy director for
operations. Gates served as Deputy Director under William Casey.

At issue is Gates's role in Iran-Contra and whether he failed to
oversee what was happening in the agency. Mr. Gates denies knowledge
of the diversion.

Robert Gates's nomination as Director of the Central Intelligence
Agency is plagued by his possible involvement in the Iran-Contra
scandal and by the promises he made when assuming the position of
Deputy Director in 1986.

Gates's promise to be involved in "all areas of decision making" and
to give special attention to CIA's "relationship with the oversight
committees" strike some in Congress as ironic as they learn more of
Col. Oliver North's freewheeling operations. Within the Senate there
is a feeling of betrayal and some scepticism of Gates's claim to be
unaware of the activities of such subordinates as George and Fiers.

What Mr. Gates knew and should have known about Iran-Contra should
determine whether he is confirmed. Although Mr. Casey may have cut
Gates off from details of the illicit program, Gates admits of hearing
rumors which he disregarded and remembers hearing North refer to Swiss
bank accounts and the Contras, but ignored the reference. If Mr. Gates
was involved in or consciously ignored the Iran-Contra operation his
nomination should be rejected by legislators of all political
persuasions. The American government was not intended to be dominated
by the executive, much less the CIA director and a Marine Corps
detailee to the NSC.

In Senate hearings on the Gates nomination the nominee has admitted
that as CIA's number two man he was hesitant to challenge the agency's
operations division. When questioned about a meeting that he and Fiers
had attended together in 1986, Gates said that he had no recollection
of specific remarks made at the meeting or of the meeting more
generally.

Under questioning by the Senate Intelligence Committee, Gates
exhibited a self- disciplined controlled style that contrasted with
frequent memory lapses regarding Iran-Contra.  Nevertheless, behind
solid unquestioning GOP support, Gates appears confident of overcoming
Democratic critics and winning the top job that eluded him in 1987.

Testimony on the Gates nomination indicates that as Deputy Director
CIA during the Reagan Administration, Gates reshaped the agency's
analytic product to fit the conservative anti- Soviet preconceptions
of Director William Casey and President Reagan.

Witnesses testified that: "Gates's role...was to corrupt the process
and the ethics of intelligence;" and Bob Gates says, "This is the
paper that Casey wants, and this is the paper that Casey is going to
get." One witness commented, "The forgetfulness of this brilliant
officer--gifted with photographic memory--does not to me instill
confidence."

The net impact of the day-long testimony was to damage Gates whose
intellectual integrity and political independence have been questioned
by some senators.

Robert Gates gave an angry rebuttal to charges that he distorted CIA
analysis to suit the policies of the Reagan administration. Yet,
several Democratic senators questioned the nominee's objectivity in
evaluating Pakistan's nuclear weapons program in the 1980's and the
Soviet role in the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II as
well as his role in the Iran- Contra affair.

Mr. Gates conceded that he had praised a study of the attempted papal
assassination, later found by an internal CIA study to be "spotty",
that he had failed to alert high officials to the follow-up study and
that he must address the perception of politicization at the agency if
confirmed as Director.

Robert Gates, described by his enemies as an enforcer for Bill Casey,
is in fact a pioneering reformer. In early 1986 he arranged a briefing
for President Reagan by four non-CIA authorities who presented the
only U.S. study that correctly assessed Soviet economic collapse and
its far-reaching consequences.

CIA Sovietologists disregarded the study insisting that the Soviet
economy was "muddling through." The analytic bureaucracy at CIA
considers itself "objective" while reformers such as Gates are termed
"political." Robert Gates is now in the dock for having failed to
predict the Soviet collapse while his accusers are the very CIA
Sovietapologists who misunderstood the nature of the Soviet Union.

Bob Gates is exactly the man needed to give the CIA bureaucracy the
shaking up it so badly needs.

The Senate has approved the nomination of Robert Gates as Director of
the Central Intelligence Agency.

The four-month confirmation process replayed the Iran-Contra affair
and charges that Gates as Deputy Director had tailored intelligence
reports to fit Director Casey's conservative agenda. In his own
testimony Gates appeared to be torn between his background as an
intellectual and his political ambitions to rise in the bureaucracy.

Gates's confirmation owes much to Senate Intelligence Chairman David
Boren who steadfastly supported the nominee and brought along the
influential Democratic chairs of the Foreign Relations and Armed
Services Committees.

Gates's challenge will be to show that he can lead the agency in the
post-Cold War world.
