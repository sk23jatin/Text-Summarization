The Senate has approved Robert Gates as the next director of the
Central Intelligence Agency after a long confirmation process that
exposed serious weaknesses in the CIA's performance during the 1980s.
Delays in the selection were caused by ongoing reviews of the
Iran-Contra scandal and other clandestine activities of the CIA during
the Reagan administration.

Mr. Gates became a leading candidate in April 1991 when CIA Director
William Webster resigned.  He previously served during the 1980s as
deputy to the hard-line Director, William Casey.  He successfully
rebutted the issue of whether he failed as Deputy Director to oversee
Agency activities.  This issue arose from testimony by former CIA
officials involved in the Iran-Contra scandal, which implicated
Mr. Gates in that operation.  Mr. Gates was sandwiched between several
officials who ran the Contra project, but he denied having any direct
knowledge of its operations.  Additionally, he rebutted claims that he
encouraged analysis pandering to the hard-line outlook of CIA's
Director William Casey, which caused bitter ideological and management
fights within the bureaucracy.  Examples were papers indicating Soviet
complicity in the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II;
overstating Moscow's influence in Tehran; and underestimating the
likelihood of Soviet economic collapse.
