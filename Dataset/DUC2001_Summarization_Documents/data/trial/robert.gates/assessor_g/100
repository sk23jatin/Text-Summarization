The Senate has approved Robert Gates as the next director of thee
Central Intelligence Agency after a long confirmation process that
exposed weaknesses in CIA performance in the 1980s.  Delays were due
primarily to questions about the extent of Mr. Gates' involvement in
the Iran-Contra affair, certain other clandestine activities, and
bureaucratic management problems.

Mr. Gates, who had previously served as deputy to thee hard-line
director of CIA, William Casey, successfully rebutted testimony
implicating him in Iran-Contra, denying direct knowledge of its
operations.  He also denied accusations that he encouraged analysis,
which pandered to the anti-Soviet outlook of Mr. Casey.
