The Senate approved Robert Gates as the next director of the Central
Intelligence Agency after a long confirmation process that exposed
serious weaknesses in the CIA's performance over the past decade.
Mr. Gates, a protégé of the late CIA Director William Casey, has been
haunted by abuses of that period.  His challenge will be to show that
he has learned from the past and will be a post-Cold War leader.

Mr. Gates became a leading contender to be head of CIA in April of
1991 when CIA Director William Webster resigned.  President Bush's
nomination of Gates over other close associates at first appeared an
easy task.  The procedure promised to become a lengthy one, likely to
drag on for months because of the Senate's ongoing review of the
Iran-Contra scandal and certain clandestine activities of the CIA
during the Reagan administration.  A central issue was whether
Mr. Gates failed as Deputy Director to oversee agency activities at
that time.  Namely, lawmakers sought testimony from former CIA
officials involved in the Iran-Contra scandal as to what they knew
about Mr. Gates' knowledge of Iran-Contra.  The primary officials in
question were Alan Fiers, head of CIA's Central American operations in
the mid-1980s, and his superior, Clair George, Deputy Director for
Operations, who served under Mr. Gates but often reported directly to
Mr. Casey.  Mr. Fiers' testimony indicated that people in the
Operations Division had knowledge of Iran-Contra operations.

Mr. Gates was sandwiched between several officials who ran the Contra
project, meeting several times with some of them.  He said he only
heard rumors of Oliver North's scheme to use proceeds of weapons sales
to Iran to fund Nicaragua's rebels.  Further doubts about Mr. Gates
came from testimony by experienced CIA analysts suggesting that bitter
ideological and management fights in CIA skewed decisions leading to
the Iran-Contra affair and distorted the US perception of the Soviet
threat in the 1980s.

The primary criticism of Mr. Gates was that he encouraged analysis
which pandered to the hard-line outlook of CIA's Director William
Casey, dividing thee CIA bureaucracy into "black-hat" policy-oriented
analysts against "white-hat" academic, objective analysts.  Examples
were papers indicating Soviet complicity in the attempted
assassination of Pope John Paul II, overstating Moscow's influence in
Tehran, and underestimating the likelihood of Soviet economic
collapse.

Throughout the confirmation process, Mr. Gates retained President
Bush's support and convincingly rebutted charges against him.
