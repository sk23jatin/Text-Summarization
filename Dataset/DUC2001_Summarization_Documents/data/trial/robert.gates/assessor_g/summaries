Central Intelligence Agency Director William Webster resigned, giving
President Bush a chance to name a close associate as successor.
Leading contenders are: Deputy National Security Advisor Robert Gates,
a former CIA chief; James Lilley, Ambassador to China and former CIA
official; former intelligence official Bobby Inman; and New Hampshire
Republican Senator Warren Reidman.  Mr. Webster said he is resigning
for personal reasons, moving now because "the war has just been
completed."  He has been praised highly by the President and CIA
officials.  Nevertheless, his departure comes at a time when some
White House officials have criticized him for lacking aggression.

President Bush's nomination of Robert Gates to head the Central
Intelligence Agency first appeared as an easy task.  Senate
Intelligence Committee considerations now, however, threaten to last
for months.  The change in prognosis is due to the investigation of
the Iran-Contra Affair, as well as concerns about CIA's role in the
BCCI Holdings and arms smuggling, and antagonisms between CIA
officials.  Namely, the Senate is questioning former CIA officials as
to what they know about Mr. Gate's knowledge of Iran-Contra; and
inquiring about complaints that he pushed analysts to make their work
less academic and more attuned to policymakers questions.

Senate hearings for nomination of Robert Gates as Director of the
Central Intelligence Agency were postponed until September while
lawmakers seek testimony from former CIA officials regarding the
Iran-Contra scandal.  The officials in question are Alan Fiers, head
of CIA's Central American operations in the mid-1980s and Fiers'
superior, Clair George, Deputy Director for Operations.  Mr. Fiers
pleaded guilty to charges of withholding information from Congress, a
development that provoked new interest in the role of CIA officials,
including Mr. Gates, in Iran-Contra affairs.  A central issue in
whether Mr. Gates failed as Deputy Director to oversee Agency
activities.

Robert Gate's hopes of heading the Central Intelligence Agency are
haunted not only by the Iran-Contra scandal but also by his previous
statements as Deputy Director.  His promises about planned
improvements have taken on a new irony given what is now known about
the scandal.  Mr. Gates says he was unaware of much of what was
happening.  He acknowledged that CIA had a "major preoccupation" with
renewal of military aid to the Contras but admits to little curiosity
about the forces' survival.  Impending testimony of two high-level CIA
officials associated with the scandal could reveal levels of knowledge
shared with Mr. Gates.

What Robert Gates knew or should have known about the Iran-Contra
project should decide whether he is confirmed as head of the Central
Intelligence Agency.  Mr. Gates said he was unaware of Oliver North's
scheme to use proceeds of weapons sales to Iran to fund Nicaragua's
Contras but admits he heard rumors of North's operation.  Sandwiched
bureaucratically between some officials who ran the Contra project, he
met several times with them.  Congress, bypassed by the Executive
Office with the Contra operation, must reject Mr. Gates' nomination if
he was involved in or consciously ignored the operation.

Senate hearings on Robert Gates' nomination to head the Central
Intelligence Agency suggest that analysis related to the Iran-Contra
affair was influenced by intimidation within the CIA.  One senior
official admitted that he was reluctant to put into writing his
suspicion of questionable activities for fear it might be shown to the
White House.  Gates himself admitted hesitancy on at least one
occasion in challenging the CIA Director's agenda on Iran.  Mr. Gates
stated he couldn't recall certain sessions mentioned in association
with Iran-Contra operations.  He revealed knowledge of CIA interaction
with banking regulators and its expected role in economic
intelligence.

Senate hearings on Robert Gates suggest that ideological and
management fights in the Central Intelligence Agency distorted
perception of the Soviet threat in the 1980s and skewed decisions
leading to the Iran-Contra affair.  Testimony of several CIA analysts
portrayed Mr. Gates as encouraging analysts pandering to thee
conservative outlook of CIA's Direction, William Casey.  Specific
examples were papers indicating Soviet complicity in the attempted
assassination of Pope John Paul II; and overstating Moscow's influence
in Tehran, involvement in terrorism, and the impact of weaponry given
to the Afghan guerrillas.  Mr. Gates was also said to be slow in
recognizing changes in the Soviet Union.

Appearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee in defense of his
candidacy to lead the CIA, Robert Gates angrily rebutted charges that
he distorted analysis to suit the Reagan administrations policies.  At
issue were suspicious questions of skewed analysis regarding
Pakistan's nuclear weapons program while using that country in the
1980s to carry out aid to Afghan resistance groups; the Iran-Contra
Affair; and assessment of the Soviet role in the attempted
assassination of Pope John Paul II.  Mr. Gates admitted that things
were called "as they saw them" and that he must address the perception
of politicization at the Agency if confirmed as Director.

President Reagan was briefed in April 1986 by four non-CIA men on the
coming economic crisis in the Soviet Union on the basis of a study the
men undertook at the instigation of Robert Gates, nominee for Director
of CIA.  It is the only correct assessment of the Soviet economic
collapse.  CIA Sovietologists' assessment that the Soviet economy was
"muddling through" is being used against Gates by those opposed to his
support of Reagan's hard-line policies.  Ironically, the non-CIA
briefing to Reagan was hard-line, consistent with Gates' "black hat"
"political" orientation against the traditional "white hat"
"objective" analysts of the divided CIA bureaucracy.

The Senate approved Robert Gates to be the next director of the
Central Intelligence Agency after a long confirmation process that
exposed serious CIA bureaucratic weaknesses in the recent past.  There
are continued doubts about his credibility from testimony that he
suppressed dissent within the CIA and tailored reports to suit Mr.
Casey's conservative agenda.  The first career CIA officer to be
director in nearly two decades, his climb owes much to thee loyalties
of Senate Intelligence Chairman David Boren (D., Okla.) and President
Bush.  His challenge will be to show he has learned from the past.
