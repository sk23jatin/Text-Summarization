The U.S. Senate approved the nomination of Robert Gates as Director of
the Central Intelligence Agency in November 1991 after four months of
hearings. Democrats charged that as deputy director Gates must have
known about the diversion of profits from Iranian arms sales to the
Contra rebels in Nicaragua, known as the Iran-Contra scandal. Gates
denied knowing although meetings he attended where related matters
were discussed suggested he did know. Gates was also accused of
exerting pressure on analysts to skew intelligence reports to suit
Reagan policies and of being slow to recognize changes in the Soviet
Union in the mid-1980s.
