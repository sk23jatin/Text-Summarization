CIA Director William Webster resigned after the end of the Gulf War
and four years in office, giving President Bush a chance to replace
the Reagan appointee with his own choice and reshape his national
security team. The Leading contender is Deputy National Security
Adviser Robert Gates, a former deputy chief of CIA. Gates wants the
job and was nominated before Webster, but withdrew because of
criticism that he failed to halt secret arms sales to Iran.  Gates'
nomination is likely to be boosted by National Security Adviser Brent
Scowcroft, with whom he has worked closely since the start of Bush's
administration.

President Bush anticipated little opposition to his Gates' nomination
as Director CIA but approval is now uncertain. Last week's admission
by CIA's Alan Fiers to knowledge of Iran-Contra will likely cause
Senate confirmation to drag on and include review of CIA activities
during Gates' tenure as Deputy Chief. Gates denies Iran-Contra
knowledge, supported by former CIA deputy director Bobby Inman who
says Director Casey encouraged covert staff to bypass his
deputy. Other issues likely to be investigated are recording of CIA
telephone calls, CIA's role in BCCI, and CIA's technological
assistance to Iraq during the Iran-Iraq War. Gates's enemies at CIA
have gone to the intelligence committee secretly with their
complaints.

Senate hearings on the nomination of Robert Gates to be Director CIA
were postponed until September. In the interim former CIA officials
will be questioned regarding Iran-Contra. Bush concurs, saying a
start-and-stop confirmation process would be unfair to Gates. At issue
is whether Gates failed as deputy director to oversee what was
happening at CIA. Gates denies Iran-Contra knowledge but records show
in May 1986 he attended a meeting with CIA Director Casey and Admiral
Poindexter regarding a proposal by Col. Oliver North for CIA to lease
a ship later known to be controlled by the secret Iran-Contra
arms-supply network. The proposal was rejected.

In nominating Robert Gates to head CIA, Bush rekindled the betrayal
Congress felt when the Iran-Contra affair erupted four years ago. CIA
Director Casey's death facilitated putting Iran-Contra blame on
him. As deputy director, Gates promised to be involved in all decision
making and improve Congressional oversight of large investment
items. Instead, documents were withheld from Congress, decision making
fell to international arms dealers, and weapons sales to Iran became a
means to sustain Nicaraguan guerrillas. Gates denies all knowledge of
Iran-Contra and accepted White House aide Oliver North's statement
that CIA was "clean" in this regard.

If Robert Gates was involved in or ignored Iran-Contra, his
confirmation as Director CIA should be rejected by conservatives and
liberals alike because Iran-Contra was an assault on our system of
checks and balances and constitutional liberty. Evidence of Gates'
knowledge includes meetings with Alan Fiers and Adm. Poindexter on
related subjects, his dismissal of Col. North's references to Contras
and Swiss bank accounts because he didn't know the context, and his
ignoring rumors because of flimsy evidence.

Senate hearings on Robert Gates' nomination as Director CIA suggest
CIA intimidation influenced Iran-Contra analysis, such as an analyst
's memo downplaying evidence of illegal activities by White House
officials, and Gates' pressuring the State Department to suppress
objections to a CIA paper laying groundwork for arms sales to
Iran. Gates claimed not to remember a 1986 CIA meeting to discuss a
shot-down cargo plane carrying supplies to Nicaraguan Contras or a
conversation with Alan Fiers about CIA buying assets owned by
Col. North's network. Gates hopes that in future CIA will help provide
economic intelligence on subsidies, trade competition, and theft of
technology from U.S. firms. Republicans support Gates solidly.

In Senate hearings on his nomination for Director CIA, Robert Gates is
accused by former colleagues of using his influence as Deputy Director
to suppress dissent and thus skew intelligence reports. Gates is
charged with panderied to Director Casey's anti-Soviet bias, being
slow to recognize changes in the Soviet Union in the mid-1980s, and
rushing through an unsupported report on Soviet involvement in an
assassination attempt on the Pope. He was said to advocate arming
ineffective Afghan rebels, bombing Libya, and selling arms to Iran
through third countries like Israel or Brazil. A colleague, citing
Gates' photographic memory, disbelieved his convenient claim in
testimony of forgetfulness,

Before a Senate Intelligence Committee considering his nomination to
Director CIA, Gates angrily rebutted charges that as deputy director
he distorted analysis to please his patron boss Casey and to suit
Reagan's policies. His comments raised suspicions that military aid to
Afghan resistance groups, carried through Pakistan, circumvented US
restrictions against assisting countries with nuclear weapons. Gates
also admitted a caveat should have accompanied a 1985 paper arguing
that Soviets were behind an assassination attempt against the
Pope. Congress may now realize how ideological differences affect what
policy makers are told and reassess its intelligence oversight role,
which traditionally focused on budget issues and covert operations.

Robert Gates, Bush nominee for Director CIA, is unfairly blamed for
CIA's failure to predict the Soviet demise. In reality, he
commissioned the independent Rowen-Wolf study whose prediction of
Soviet collapse was more accurate than that of CIA Soviet analysts,
who insisted the Soviets would muddle through. Democrats want to
discredit 1980s U.S. defense spending and hard-line Reagan
policies. Also, there is internal CIA dissension between "white hat"
traditional analysts, who think sound foreign policy starts with
realities, favored by academics and Congressional Democrats; and
"black hat" modernists who favor political considerations,identified
with Casey and Gates. Gates' enemies fear changes to the CIA
bureaucracy that Gates will make.

In a 64-31 vote, the Senate approved Robert Gates as Director CIA
after a four-month confirmation process that exposed serious
weaknesses in CIA's performance over the past decade. Gates was
championed for the job by President Bush and conservative Senate
Intelligence Chairman David Boren. Armed Services Committee Chairman
Sam Nunn was convinced to support Gates but still had doubts. Former
CIA colleagues claimed that Gates suppressed dissent and tailored
intelligence reports to suit the conservative agenda of his patron and
boss, Director William Casey. Republicans tried to suppress questions
about Gates' knowledge of Iran-Contra and CIA's tilt toward Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.
