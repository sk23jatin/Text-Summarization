The U.S. Senate approved the nomination of Robert Gates as Director of
the Central Intelligence Agency in November 1991 by a 64-31
vote. President Bush nominated the former deputy director to the post
after Director William Webster resigned in May 1991. Gates was
approved in November after four months of hearings by the Senate
Intelligence Committee which exposed inner workings of intelligence
analysis and bitter infighting at CIA.

Democratic opposition to Gates' nomination was based on concern that
Gates failed as deputy director to oversee what was happening in the
agency and pressured analysts to skew intelligence to suit Reagan
administration priorities.

Problems arose concerning whether Gates knew about the diversion of
profits from Iranian arms sales to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua,
known as the Iran-Contra scandal, before it became public. This
rekindled the sense of betrayal Congress felt when the Iran-Contra
affair first erupted. Formal hearings on Gates' nomination were
postponed until after testimony was heard from former CIA officials
regarding Iran-Contra knowledge.

Some evidence suggested Gates did know. In May 1986 he attended a
meeting regarding a proposal by Col. Oliver North that CIA lease a
ship that later turned out to have been purchased with profits from
the sale of arms to Iran. Gates also talked about CIA purchasing the
entire Contra resupply system if Congress approved more aid. And Gates
attended a meeting in Casey's office following the shoot-down of a
cargo plane carrying Contra supplies. Also, an official one step below
Gates and Gates' superior knew, so Gates should have known too,
although according to former Deputy Director Bobby Inman, Casey
encouraged the covert operations staff to bypass his deputy.

Gates was also said to exert pressure on lower-ranking analysts and
other agencies to skew reports to suit Casey's anti-Soviet bias, and
to suppress dissent concerning theories of Soviet complicity in the
Pope assassination attempt and Soviet influence in the Third World. He
was accused of being slow to recognize changes in the Soviet Union in
the mid-1980s even though he commissioned an outside study which
contradicted CIA analysts' belief that the Soviets would muddle
through. Gates was also accused of overstating the impact of US
weaponry given to Afghan guerrillas to fight the Soviets.

Gates denied all prior knowledge of Iran-Contra and charges of
bias. Support for Gates within CIA was split. Some listeners doubted
Gates' claims of forgetting key meetings, citing his brilliance and
photographic memory.
