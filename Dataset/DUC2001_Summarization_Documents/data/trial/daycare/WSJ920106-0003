   WASHINGTON -- The Internal Revenue Service made it easier
for day-care providers to claim a tax deduction for the
business use of their homes.
   The ruling is designed to clarify a position the IRS took
last year that many providers feared would force them to pay
higher taxes and lead to an increase in child-care charges.

   In essence, the ruling will allow licensed providers to
deduct costs associated with any area of their home that is
used regularly for day care -- even if the area is not used
for day care every hour of the business day.
   "A day-care provider is not required to keep records of
the specific hours of usage of such a room during business
hours," the ruling said. "Also, the occasional nonuse of such
a room for a business day will not disqualify the room from
being considered regularly used."
   The new statement, Revenue Ruling 923, is "a complete
reversal" of the position the IRS took last April in an audit
dispute with one care provider in St. Paul, Minn., said Tom
Copeland of a St. Paul group, Resources for Child Caring.
"The language is exactly what we want," he said. "This is the
way providers have been doing it for a number of years."
   In the audit dispute, which led to widespread protests and
to bills proposed in Congress to foil the IRS, the IRS sought
to have the care provider account for each hour of use of
each room in her home.
   "Instead of providers having to say, for example, that a
bedroom was used three hours a day and the kitchen two hours,
they can count the rooms as being used for the total day as
long as they are regularly used and available for day care,"
IRS spokeswoman Gail Ellis said.
