   Child-Care Setups
   Still Fall Apart Often

   WORKING parents' child-care arrangements continue to break
down at a surprising rate, despite growing public and private
investment in the nation's child-care system.
   Although most parents strive for continuity, studies show
that about one-half of employed mothers who pay for child
care change their arrangements each year, says Arthur C.
Emlen, a professor emeritus at Portland State University in
Oregon and a consultant on dependent-care issues. The reasons
cited most often: a care giver quit, the cost was too high,
the hours were wrong, the location was inconvenient, a child
was unhappy or a parent disliked the care giver.
   The problem is costly for employers. Preliminary data from
a survey of 2,300 employed mothers, set for release next
month, show that 15% reported some time lost from work in the
past month because child care had broken down. The Child Care
Action Campaign, an advocacy group, puts the annual cost to
U.S. business at $3 billion.
   "I don't see much evidence that turnover has gotten
better" in recent years, says Mr. Emlen, who has studied
dependent care since 1965. The supply of relatives who help
out has dwindled as more women have taken other jobs. Also,
"people's standards are going up," Mr. Emlen says.
   Meg Mahoney, a Minneapolis-area mother, missed two days as
a retail buyer after her sitter gave her less than a day's
notice that she was quitting to take a manufacturing job.
When an Eden Prairie, Minn., preschool filed for protection
from creditors, Thomas J. Schmid, a professor at Mankato
State University, lost a lot of work time and finally had to
transfer his two-year-old to a more distant school.
   Suzanne Shelton-Foley has had seven child-care
arrangements for her five-year-old twins. She recently
started a public relations and marketing firm in Chicago to
gain flexibility. "It's gotten to the point where I'm no
longer surprised when someone says, `I'm sorry this report is
a week late, but my sitter quit,'" she says.
                                                                                                       

   School, Employers Spur
   Parental Involvement
                                                                                                       

   FOR A LONG TIME, Jim McCormick didn't know his
eight-year-old son was having trouble reading at school. The
child might still be struggling, except for an unusual
program sponsored by Mr. McCormick's employer, Ridgeview
Inc., and school officials in Newton, N.C.
   Every two months, seven school counselors visit the maker
of hosiery and socks for 15-minute conferences with 57
parents who work there. After Mr. McCormick, a supervisor,
met with his son's counselor, he started working with the
child at home, and the boy overcame his problem.
   The three-year-old program has cut truancy to zero among
children of participants, says Susan McGee, a guidance
counselor, who helped invent it. The program draws 100%
participation by more than 100 parents at two participating
employers. Before the program started, workers had to take a
pay cut for time lost attending school conferences.
   Counselors are seeing parents who haven't set foot in a
school since they graduated or dropped out. Participation by
fathers has also soared -- a benefit of "meeting parents on
their own turf," Ms. McGee says. "And it costs us nothing but
our time."
                                                                                                       

   Baby Boom Faces Care
   Of Aging Relatives
                                                                                                       

   AS BABY BOOMERS age, the average worker may soon have more
older relatives than children to care for.
   Most employers think of child care as the most common area
of conflict between work and family, and it tends to be the
family issue raised most often by employees and political
groups. But over the next three decades, the number of
dependent elders -- primarily aging relatives or in-laws who
need intermittent or constant caremay actually surpass the
number of dependent children in the U.S., Census Bureau
statistics show. That seems certain to shift public pressure
toward more elder-care help, such as adult day care or
broader tax breaks for elder care expenses.
   Much depends on such uncertainties as the future rate at
which people have babies and die and the number of immigrants
who settle in the U.S., says Mercedes Bern-Klug, an analyst
for the National Institute on Aging. Also, there is no way of
telling how many people in a certain age group will be
dependent.
   Nevertheless, by the year 2020, Americans under the age of
18 are expected to drop to 19% to 24% of the population from
26% currently, Census Bureau projections show. At the same
time, people over 65 will rise to 20% of the population,
compared with 13% now. By the year 2040, an estimated 17% to
24% will be under 18, with 26% to 28% over 65.
   The trend is already in place. A recent International
Business Machines survey showed the proportion of its
employees with elder dependents doubled between 1986 and
1991, to 16% from 8%.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   FLEXIBLE WORK schedules are paying unexpected dividends
for Wells Fargo. At no cost to the company, its corporate
library is now open more than seven hours longer each week
because employees have juggled their workloads and hours to
meet family and other personal needs. Some workers start
later and stay later, while others work longer days in
exchange for time off on other days. . . . For the 13 million
American children who move each year, Kidvidz, Newton, Mass.,
offers an award-winning video, "Let's Get a Move On." Four
children give tips on dealing with the loneliness, anger and
feelings of powerlessness that a move can raise.
