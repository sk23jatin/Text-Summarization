High quality, affordable child care is becoming a larger issue.  In
addressing the problem, the high cost of child care and the low pay of
workers must be considered.  In a well run center, only about half of
the gross revenue is available for wages.  Child-care workers earn
less than 60% per hour of other female workers with an equal
education.  Higher wages can be achieved in only three ways: a
reduction in overhead expenses; a rise in revenue per child; or an
increase in the child/worker ratio.  American parents seem unable to
pay more and unwilling to increase the child/worker ratio.

Many child-care centers are becoming surrogate extended families to
increase appeal.  They are becoming more flexible, including 24-7
availability and convenient locations, and offering novel services
such as vacationer/conventioneer support, recreational classes,
transportation service, and take-home meals.  At the same time they
have developed sophisticated marketing strategies to actually make
money in an industry with a tight profit margin.  Their target clients
are affluent, two-income families and corporations.  Parents need more
than traditional day care and some are willing to pay for it and
employers are willing to subsidize it.  Successful companies include
Sunrise Preschools Inc. and Lakeshore Teaching and Learning Center.

With ever more two-paycheck couples, nannies have become a hot
commodity.  More than 500 placements agencies have sprung up
nation-wide.  Many do a conscientious job, but some dissatisfied
customers tell of unchecked references, deficient screening, broken
contracts and unrefunded fees.  Many nannies are recruited from rural
areas in the West or Midwest and have little formal training.
Matching nannies to families is a delicate process and some nannies
have problems adjusting to the cities.  Parents warn "consumer
beware", while agencies point out that some families are problems.  A
nanny advocacy group is pushing for national standards and training
credentials for caregivers.

A new U.S. Census Bureau survey of how children are cared for and the
ability of low-income families to afford care will bolster legislation
to aid low-income families, which is currently under consideration.
In 1987, 55% of mothers with children under five were employed.
Organized day care centers cared for 2.2 million (almost one quarter)
of these children with an average weekly cost of $49.  Children living
at the poverty level usually are cared for by relatives, although many
mothers would prefer organized child- care facilities, which could
cost one fourth of their income.  Current legislation would help with
costs and broaden choices.

Kinder-Care Learning Centers Inc. brought back Tull Gearreald as
president and CEO, replacing J. Phillip Samper who resigned.
Gearreald had been interim CEO from last February to June, before
being replaced by Samper.  A professional manager, Samper's plans to
generate income and reduce debt had failed.  According to Ken Miller,
the company chairman, the 45 year-old Gearreald, was rehired because
he knows the company, is "financially sophisticated and is popular
with employees."  While a restructuring study is under way, he plans
to conserve cash by opening fewer centers.  Kinder-Care stock was up
15.625.

While small companies are not expected to be able to offer child-care
benefits, some are trying anyway.  A new report from a child-care
advocacy group discussed 29 small-company (fewer than 250 employees)
programs.  Experiments include day-care centers, subsidies, referral
services, flexible benefit programs, and dependent-care assistance
plans.  Many companies report employees morale is up, hiring is
easier, turnover is down, and community image is enhanced.  Problems
include haggling over zoning and building-code regulations, trying to
limit liability for safety, skimping on staff, the inability to hire
consultants, and employee abuse.  Not all companies will be able to
continue.

Working parents' child-care arrangements continue to break down
frequently, despite a growing investment in the system.  About one
half of employed mothers who pay for child care change arrangements
each year, according to one study.  The hours or location is wrong or
participants do not get along.  Additionally the supply of relatives
to help has dwindled as more women take jobs.  The annual cost to
U.S. business of lost work to solve child-care problems is put at $3
billion by an advocacy group.

A growing number of big companies are joining joint ventures to try
creative solutions to the nation's child-care problems, believed to
cost U.S. business some $3 billion a year.  Corporate dollars, aimed
at raising the supply and quality of care, are beginning to make a
difference.  Joint day-care centers have been built.  Other programs
are creating new slots for children in family day-care centers.
Programs also offer incentives for professional training programs that
focus on health and safety issues and entrepreneurship.  Other
companies have found that even a small increase in employee benefits,
such as low-cost health benefits, have a big impact on turnover and
credentials of child-care workers.

As the problem of child care for working parents continues to fester,
employers' selective flexibility is creating a new cast system.  The
conflict pits men against women, mothers against other mothers,
professional women against nonprofessionals, and children's needs
against those of the employers.  The family-leave bill, mandating
unpaid leave for most workers, would even things out.  President Bush
and business are against it.  Corporate attorneys warn of legal
pitfalls associated with the failure to establish policies for
child-care issues such as job security, maternity benefits, granting
flexible schedules, and cost of company child care.  Thus far
employees seem to be seething rather than suing.

The Internal Revenue Service made it easier for day-care providers to
claim a tax deduction for the business use of their homes.  The ruling
will allow licensed providers to deduct costs associated with any area
of their home that is used regularly for day care.  The provider is
not required to keep records of the specific hours of usage of each
room.  This is a complete reversal of the IRS position last April,
which providers feared would force a rise in day-care costs.
According to Tom Copeland of Resources for Child Caring, "this is the
way providers have been doing it for a number of years."
