With the marked increase in two-paycheck families, there is an
ever-increasing need for affordable and quality child care.

Most agencies do a good job but some do not.  Child care is plagued by
a lack of employee standards, low pay and education.

Even after child care is found, one-half of working mothers change
their service every year.

Money is a major factor for both providers and parents.  A recent
survey expresses concern about the affordability of child care by the
poor.

Parents are not alone in the money crunch.  The largest day care
center in the U.S. is struggling to restructure its debt.

Small firms providing care to parent employees have difficulty
manipulating scarce resources.  Large corporations are pooling
resources in establishing day care centers.  Corporate dollars are
making a difference.

The Internal Revenue Service has provided some tax relief to small
in-home care providers.

Companies also need to be aware of the legal aspects of providing
child care benefits to a select few.

Some centers are expanding their care to 24 hours, are developing
standards, and are providing for the care of sick children.  This is
welcome news for parents.
