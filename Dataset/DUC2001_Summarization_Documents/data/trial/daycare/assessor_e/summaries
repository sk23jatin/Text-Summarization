Employed parents are currently facing the problem of an increasing
need for affordable and quality child care.  Licensed child care is
often too expensive, thus forcing working parents to accept lower
quality care.
      
Child care is not without its inherent problems. It is plagued by the
need to improve its standards as well as employee pay and education.
Its employees also lack a collective bargaining position.

An increase in the child worker ratio probably offers the best hope
for a solution.  This choice should be made by parents and providers
rather than someone concerned with the economics of child care.

Some child care facilities are greatly expanding their services to
working parents.  These services include child care on a 24-hour,
seven-day per week basis.

Other child care facilities are expanding their physical plants to
include gyms, swimming classes, and transportation to sporting events.

Child care centers are making renewed efforts to market their
business. One center has contracted with a local public relations firm
for broad scale advertising to the public.

Managers of the new approach to child care are beginning to realize a
profit in an industry with a notoriously low profit margin.

In the search for child care, turning to a high profile agency is no
guarantee of reliable service.  It may result in a lawsuit for poor or
negligent service.

The increasing number of two-paycheck parents searching for nannies
has resulted in a proliferation of child care agencies.  Most do a
good job.  For those that do not, complaints include unchecked
references, deficient screening, broken contracts and unrefunded fees.
Complaints against nannies include poor training and child abuse.

In an attempt to prevent abuses within this burgeoning industry, some
organizations are establishing national standards and training
credentials for nannies.

A recent 1977-1987 Census Bureau survey reports major trends in child
care in the U.S. and indicates concern about the affordability of
child care by the poor.

The use of relatives as day care providers declined, probably
reflecting in part the greater number of female relatives of poorer
families who entered the work force.

According to the survey, poor families spend about one fourth of their
income on probably less quality child care. This compares with one
sixth spent by higher income families.

The report could support current congressional legislation to provide
financial assistance to low income families.

Tull Gearreald has returned to Kinder Care Learning Centers, Inc., as
president and chief executive officer.  J. Phillip Samper, who
succeeded Gearreald in June, resigned.

Kinder Care, of Montgomery, Alabama, is the nation's largest day care
center operator.  The change comes as the corporation is struggling to
restructure its debt.

Mr. Samper, a management expert, attempted to reduce the corporation's
debt by selling off some of its centers in a lease-back plan; however,
bank credit dried up.

Kinder Care rehired Gearreald for his financial expertise and his
popularity with employees.

Corporation efforts will be toward restructuring and opening fewer
centers.

Firms offering their employees child care benefits solve a difficult
problem for parents.  For the small firm, however, it can be a frantic
exercise in the manipulation of scant resources.

Benefits include subsidies, referrals, flexible benefit programs, and
dependent care assistance plans.

Small companies do not attract enough children to prevent the care
center from running a deficit, forcing centers to close.  Small firms
must also limit their liability for child safety.

Many company owners, however, have an interest in keeping such centers
viable when they enroll their own children.  They believe the centers
are good for business and help morale.

Statistics show that, in spite of the growing public and private
investment in the U.S. child care system, about one-half of employed
mothers paying for child care change their providers each year.  The
reasons include high cost, hours or location are inconvenient, an
unhappy child or parent dislike of a caregiver, or the caregiver
resigns.

The breakdown of child care arrangements is expensive for employees
and it is responsible for about 15 percent in lost work time.
Disruption often occurs without notice.  As more women enter the work
force, there are fewer relatives available to act as a replacement.

U.S. corporations are joining together in the establishment of child
care centers.  This trend results from productivity loss brought on by
the shortage and the high cost of quality child care.

Corporate dollars are making the difference.  In the new centers,
child-teacher ratios are one-half the national average, and pay and
benefits are above average.  The centers are well-staffed, and often
give peace of mind to company parents.

Some corporate partnerships have provided a critical solution:
establishment of centers for the care of sick children.

Corporate collaboration may be the best response to chronic child care
problems.

The world of child care is loaded with pitfalls.

These dangers include: the unequal distribution of employee child care
leave benefits to only one sex; development of a caste system based on
distribution of benefits by employers to the favored few; the fears of
women that child care problems will interfere with job prospects; and
the resentment by other employees against parent employees who receive
benefits.

These conflicts pit men against women, high level employees against
lower level, and employee against employer.

Companies often do not recognize the legal aspects of distributing
benefits to a select few and they do so at their peril.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has given welcome relief to home
day care providers.  A recent ruling allows providers to deduct costs
associated with any area of their home that is used regularly and is
available for day care.

The recent ruling is a reversal of a previous position in which the
care provider was required to account for each hour of use of each
room in the home.  The old ruling led to protests and bills in
Congress.

The new ruling will save the provider much paperwork, preclude both
the payment of higher taxes and an increase in child care charges.
