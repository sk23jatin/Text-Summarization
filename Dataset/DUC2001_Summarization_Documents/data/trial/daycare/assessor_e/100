There is a large increase in the number of two-paycheck families
seeking child care.

Most agencies do a good job but some do not. Adding to the chaos is
that one-half of working mothers change providers every year.

In spite of some tax relief by the IRS, money is a major factor. There
is concern about the poor's ability to pay. Companies providing care
are struggling to keep centers open. There are legal aspects to
providing care benefits to the few.

On the plus side, some centers are open 24 hours, provide care for
sick children, and are adopting standards.
