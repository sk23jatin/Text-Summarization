New mothers returning to work are calling for high quality affordable
child care.  Many employed parents complain that licensed child care
is too expensive and causes them to accept day-care of uncertain
quality.  Licensed child-care workers are already paid about 40% lower
salaries than other women.  They are willing to accept low wages
because they are likely to be married with three or more children and
therefore need to work close to home.

The National Academy of Sciences urges additional government supports
for child care and recommends a tightening of the standards regulating
the ratio of children to day-care workers.  If day care workers were
required to handle fewer children, the cost of day care would increase
in order to keep the already low salaries of day care workers stable.

Child-care arrangements remain unreliable despite growing public and
private investment in child-care systems.  About one-half of employed
mothers who pay for child care change care givers each year. About 345
out of 2,300 women surveyed reported lost time from work in the past
month.  The problem cost employers about $3 billion annually.

Working mothers can no longer depend on relatives to provide day-care
on a regular or emergency basis.  More and more women have taken other
jobs and are not available to care for young family members.  Other
day-care workers often quit with little or no notice leaving mothers
with no alternative but to take time off from work until they can make
new arrangements.

Many child-care centers are becoming surrogate extended families to
harried working parents.  Some facilities provide child-care any time
of day or night.  Some offer gym and swimming classes, and
transportation to baseball and soccer games.

Many elaborate child-care centers are making money in an industry with
tight profit margins.  Corporations commonly subsidize off-site spaces
for day care that are within 10 to 20 minutes away and pay upwards of
30% of the cost of tuition for their employees.  For example, Sunrise
Preschools, Inc. runs a 24 hours, seven-day-a week center to
accommodate America West Airlines flight attendants, baggage handlers
and other employees with diverse work schedules.

Some mothers are turning to costly agencies to find nannies to care
for their children.  Agency fees can run from $400 to $2,500 to supply
nannies.  Many of those nannies are turning out to be less than ideal.
Parents are complaining about thefts, drug use, child abuse, and
laziness after the agencies say that they have checked references of
the nannies they are supplying.  If a nanny proves to be
unsatisfactory, it is often difficult for parents to get back the
referral fees paid without filing a lawsuit. One such lawsuit was
filed after a nanny gave a prescription anti-depressant to an
eight-month-old for crying.  The baby almost died.

In order to make high-quality day care affordable, many large
corporations are joining together to stretch their child-care
dollars. The high cost to corporations to set up quality day care for
their employees have caused some corporations to work together.  They
are pooling funds to provide centers with more teachers per child
allowing specialized care.  The increase in teachers also provides a
calmer environment that is reflected in better behavior of the
children.

Joint efforts allow teachers to be paid better and receive benefits
such as health care.  This tends to decrease the turn over of child
care providers and increase the quality of applicants.

A US Census bureau survey on childcare and low-income families could
provide fuel for legislation already in congress.  According to Helen
Bank a childcare expert with the Children's Defense Fund, legislation
now in Congress "would help with costs and widen choices" for
low-income families.
 
The results confirm that poor families pay a higher percentage of
their family income for child care services than do higher income
families.  The survey shows that an average of about 25% of the
lower-income families' weekly resources are spent on childcare while
only 6% of higher-income families' weekly earnings goes to childcare.

Kinder-Care Learning Centers, INC. reinstated Tull Gearreld as
President and CEO.  Mr.  Gearreld first became involved with
Kinder-Care in 1998 and was replaced after a few months when
Mr. Miller, the company's chairman hired Mr. Samper in June of this
year.

According to Mr. Miller, Mr. Gearreld was rehired because he knows the
companies situation and is "Financially Sophisticated" and popular
with employees.  Currently Kinder-Care stock is valued at 71.875
cents.  A restructuring study by Coopers & Amp Lybrand is underway at
this time and Mr. Gearreld will use the study to produce a plan for
the firm's creditors within sixty days.  He also said the company
would conserve cash by opening fewer centers, while continuing to
invest in its existing facilities.

Small companies that try to provide day-care centers for their
employees often run into financial problems.  Generally, there may not
be enough children to support the cost of running a center.  Some
companies are solving this problem by opening up the centers to the
public.  In other cases, small company-run day care centers have been
good for business.  They say that hiring is easier, maternity leaves
are shorter and turnover is off by as much as 50%.

Still, small businesses face a tougher time than big businesses in
offering child-care benefits.  One problem is caused by not having
enough employees to handle administrative hassles such as meeting
zoning and building-code regulations.

The Internal Revenue Service now allows licensed day-care provider to
deduct costs for any portion of their home used for regular day care
during any part of the day.  No records are required for specific
hours of usage and a room does not have to be used every business day
to quality.

IRS Ruling 923 is a new position since last April when the IRS had a
dispute with one woman.  They wanted her to account for each hour of
use of each room in her home.  Now a provider can count any rooms used
for a portion of the day as long as they are regularly used and
available for day care.

Paid child-care leave has not been extended equally among workers in
some companies especially if the person requesting the leave happens
to be a man. In some cases when both men and women have been denied
the same benefits received by some women in the same offices, they
have chosen to resign and seek employment elsewhere.

Corporate attorneys warn that employers are failing to establish
policies protecting themselves from the pitfalls of giving benefits to
the few.  A Pittsburgh court ruled against a company that refused a
male employee the same parental leave that was offered to a woman.
The Equal Opportunity commission cited that case when it issued new
guidelines stating that employers must offer the same leave to both
men and women.
