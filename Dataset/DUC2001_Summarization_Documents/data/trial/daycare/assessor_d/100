Working mothers and employees are looking for ways to improve the
availability of reliable day care that is affordable.  To provide for
a more stable workforce, corporations are creating day-care centers
for their employees.  Small companies find these centers expensive but
good for business. Many large corporations are pooling their resources
to establish day care facilities to be used by the employees of two or
more firms.

Meanwhile the day-care centers themselves are providing more services
for working parents.  Some facilities provide their services around
the clock to accommodate diverse work schedules and life styles.

Parents and employees both benefit when there are a variety of choices
for effective day care.
