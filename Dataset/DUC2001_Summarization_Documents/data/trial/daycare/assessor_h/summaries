The need for high quality affordable child care is growing as half of
all new mothers return to paid employment within a year. Licensed
child care is expensive while provider wages, dependent on revenue per
child and overhead, are the lowest of any major occupation, 30-60
percent less than for kindergarten or elementary school teachers, who
are likely to have four more years of schooling and be highly
unionized.  The French daycare system, whose workers are as well
educated and paid as elementary school teachers, is often hailed as a
model for the U.S. although its child/worker ratio is double.

Many daycare centers are becoming surrogate extended families offering
aound the clock care and extras like swimming classes, transportation
to sports activities, and on-site immunization shots. Sunrise
Preschools, with 14 centers in Phoenix and Hawaii, sets up satellite
facilities for conventions and resorts. Venture capitalist Lepercq
Capital Management has invested in 12 centers in Pennsylvania and New
Jersey and is looking at expanding. Lakeshore Teaching & Learning
Center in Chicago has 99% occupancy although it is the area's most
expensive center. Sophisticated marketing for these full-service
centers targets affluent two-income families and also corporations who
often subsidize enrollment.

With more two-paycheck couples around, Nannies have become a hot
commodity. 500 agencies exist nationally to supply them for fees of
$400-$2500. Most nannies are young women with child-care experience
but little formal training. Screening involves getting childcare and
character references and checking background. Weekly salaries range
from $150-$450 or more plus room and board, and sometimes health
insurance, paid vacations and holidays, and use of a car. Problems
sometimes arise resulting from inadequate screening, lack of
compatibility, or disputes over agency fees. The International Nanny
Association is pushing for national standards and training
credentials.

A new Census Bureau survey showing how children are cared for in the
US increases concern about affordable childcare for low-income
families and could bolster childcare legislation now in
Congress. Childcare costs average 25% of income for poor families and
6% for the better off. The proportion of children in daycare doubled
from 1977 to 1987. Fewer relatives are used as daycare providers,
reflecting the increase in working women. 66% of preschoolers are
cared for in their homes or the homes of others. Many low-income women
would prefer the developmental benefits of center-based preschool but
can't afford it.

Kinder-Care Learning Centers, the nation's largest daycare center
operator with 1258 centers, is struggling to restructure its debt
after missing interest payments on loans. President J. Phillip Samper
resigned after his effort to reduce debt by selling the daycare
centers and leasing them back fell through.  Alabama-based Kinder-Care
plans to conserve cash by opening fewer centers. Former president and
CEO Tull Gearreald, replaced in June after a falling-out with his
partner in parent company Lodestar Group, was reinstated. Lodestar
Group is a merchant banking fund and merger advisory firm with more
than half its fund invested in Kinder-Care.

Some small companies, in spite of limited resources, are offering
employees childcare benefits such as referral services, subsidies, or
on-site daycare centers. Companies offering benefits are often owned
by parents with childcare needs of their own, or employ a high
percentage of women. Offering childcare benefits is good for a
business's image, plus morale and productivity go up, hiring is
easier, maternity leaves are shorter, and turnover drops as much as
50%. Problems include administrative hassles that sap a small staff
and complaints of inequitable benefits by non-parents. Small companies
must also be careful to limit liability.

Daycare problems are costly to employers. Arrangements frequently
breakdown and employees lose time lose from work. Half of employed
mothers change paid daycare arrangements each year because of a
caregiver quitting, high cost, wrong hours, inconvenient location, an
unhappy child, or a parent's dislike of a caregiver.  Relatives who
provide daycare have dwindled as more women go to work. Plus over the
next three decades, the number of dependent elders may surpass the
number of dependent children in the U.S., depending on birth and death
rates and the number of immigrants. Public pressure is likely to shift
to demands for more eldercare help.

Worried that a shortage of high-quality childcare is hurting
productivity, a growing number of companies are forming joint ventures
to stretch benefit dollars.  Creative solutions include subsidizing
facilities and efforts to win accreditation, offering childcare
workers incentives to get professional training and health benefits to
improve retention and quality, promoting new home-based centers, and
building centers of their own. The biggest collaboration so far is a
two million dollar center in Charlotte, NC, financed by IBM and four
partners, open to sponsors' employees and the public. Allstate
Insurance published a guidebook to help managers seek out childcare
collaborators.

Companies that use selective flexibility in childcare benefits,
allowing women to take leave but not men, or letting favored employees
cut special deals, invite discrimination suits and breed
resentment. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued
guidelines stating that employers offering leave to mothers must offer
the same leave to fathers, but President Bush has threatened to veto a
family-Leave bill mandating unpaid leave for most workers. Businesses
say it infringes on their flexibility to plan for their own labor
needs, and that poor performers and easily replaceable employees
should not get special childcare arrangements because it would not
benefit shareholders.

The IRS issued a ruling that makes it easier for daycare providers to
claim tax deductions for business use of their homes. Licensed
providers may now deduct costs associated with any area of their home
that is used regularly for daycare even if not used for that purpose
every hour of the business day. The provider is not required to keep
records of specific hours of usage. The ruling came about as a result
of protest over an audit dispute last April, in which the IRS sought
to have the provider account for each hour of use of each room.
