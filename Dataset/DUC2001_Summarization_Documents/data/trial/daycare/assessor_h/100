The U.S. need for quality affordable child care is a growing problem
as more women work outside the home. The federal government has voted
support to day care. and companies have found that offering daycare
assistance such as subsidies, referral services and on-site centers
raises employee morale and increases productivity. Some daycare chains
provide 24 hour coverage and other services. Daycare wages are the
lowest of any major occupation. The French daycare system, whose
workers are well educated and paid, is hailed as a model.Nannies,
another daycare option, are supplied for fees of $400-$2500 and earn
$150 to $450 per week.
