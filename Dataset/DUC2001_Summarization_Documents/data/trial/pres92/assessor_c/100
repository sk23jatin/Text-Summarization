Wall Street Journal articles appearing between July 1991 and January
1992 characterized the declared Democratic candidates as an inept
group.  They were Kerrey, Tsongas, Harkin, Clinton, Wilder and Brown.
Better-known candidates had opted out of the race.  The potentially
formidable Cuomo was still only a possibility.  Clinton won the first
actual test of strength, a mid-December non-binding "straw vote in
Florida."  The Democrats used their first televised debate to attack
Bush on economic grounds.  By January Bush's approval rating was
slipping, and pundits predicted a close November election with Bush
prevailing over Clinton.
