There has been a pronounced lack of activity by nationally
prominent Democrats who are regarded as potential candidates in
the race for the 1992 nomination.  This has been most noticeable
in New Hampshire and Iowa, states that offer early tests of a
candidate's strength.  Some Democratic leaders attribute the
reluctance of would-be candidates to the formidable approval
rating of President Bush.  This allows the administration to
dominate public discourse, and thereby hinder Democratic
fund-raising efforts.  Analysts conclude that this won't change
until the leading figures clarify their plans.

Senator Albert Gore has announced that he would not be a
candidate for the presidency in 1992, basing his decisions on
personal considerations.  Some Democrats feel that Gore's
decision, whatever the reason, is further indication that 1992 is
shaping up as a Republican year.  Senators Bradley of New Jersey
and Rockefeller of West Virginia bowed out of the race, leaving
only the lightly regarded Senators Tsongas of Massachusetts and
Harkin of Iowa as announced candidates.  Attention is now focused
on the enigmatic Governor Cuomo of New York. Other than Cuomo,
the most promising possibility is Governor Clinton of Arkansas.

Candidates of the Democratic Party who espouse moderate views
have not done well in their campaigns to become the party's
nominees for the presidency.  Senators Gore, Glenn and Hollings,
as well as Governor Babbitt, are regarded as moderates who failed
in mustering support for their cause.  The party's liberal wing
dominates the nominating phase, and it is the interest groups on
the left that provide the money and the endorsements.  Moderates
who are overly strident in proclaiming their views quickly lose
favor.

The New Hampshire primary is only four months away, and the
Democratic candidates for the presidency are far behind the
candidates in previous years in polishing their messages and
organizing their workers.  The six candidates who have made some
kind of appearance in New Hampshire are Senators Kerrey of
Nebraska, Tsongas of Massachusetts and Harkin of Iowa, and
Governors Wilder of Virginia and Clinton of Arkansas and Jerry
Brown who is a former governor of California. None of these men
have been tested at the national level, and their lack of
experience has shown up in New Hampshire.

Each of the six Democrats who are vying to become his party's
nominee for the president wants to be seen as an "outsider".
Even so, they are quick to go inside the beltway to raise the
money necessary to fund their campaigns.  Senator Harkin of Iowa
and Governor Clinton seem to be the most active in enlisting
Washington "insiders" to raise funds, but all the candidates, even
former Governor Brown of California, who made running against the
Washington establishment the centerpiece of his campaign, have
made some use of Washington lobbyists.

This weekend marks a critical juncture for those in the race to
become the presidential nominee of the Democratic Party. A
non-binding straw vote of convention delegates will be held on
Florida.  Hours after that is completed, the six candidates will
participate in a nationally televised debate, and this could be
of great importance to the candidates.  It also appears that
Governor Cuomo of New York is nearing a decision as to entering
the race, and if he does the entire contour of the race will
change.  Further, the up-coming deadline for candidate financial
reports will provide an indicator of the strength of the
candidates.

The six declared Democratic candidates who participated in a
Sunday night televised debate used the opportunity to attack
President Bush.  The candidates agreed that there should be help
for the middle class, but did disagree with one another's
positions on certain questions.  Except for one flare-up between
former Governor Brown and Senator Kerrey, there were no bitter
exchanges.  The debate followed closely upon the Florida straw
vote in which Governor Clinton was a decisive winner.  Governor
Cuomo has not announced his candidacy and did not participate in
the debate or the Florida straw vote, but he was on the minds of
the candidates and the Florida delegates.

Democratic candidates for the presidency feel that the public is
growing impatient with President Bush's passive approach to an
economy that is in a recession.  The six declared candidates have
offered a wide-ranging collection of economic proposals; tax cuts
for the middle class, tax incentives for investment and savings,
and spending on health, education, roads, high-speed
transportation, and in other areas.  The plan enunciated by each
candidate differed in some way from that offered by one or more
of the other candidates.  By far the most popular proposal is the
middle class tax cut which is embraced by four of the six
candidates.

Democrats running for president realize that President Bush's
forte is foreign policy, and as a consequence, they are
attempting to blur the distinction between foreign and domestic
policy.  In the aftermath of the Cold War the Democrats feel that
they have an opportunity to change the way voters think about
foreign policy.  One candidate, Governor Clinton, has laid out a
broad strategy in which he says, "national security is largely
economic". All Democratic candidates have spoken out on national
security or foreign affairs, but they have couched their
pronouncements in economic terms.

A panel of political experts, meeting as the New Hampshire
primary nears, agree that no candidate is doing well.  They say
that President Bush is off to terrible start, and that he faces a
challenge from Pat Buchanan in New Hampshire where he has little
to win and a lot to lose.  The Democratic candidates are
portrayed as a mediocre bunch, the weakest group to surface in
many years.  The pundits conclude that unless the economy gets
even worse President Bush will stumble to a close November
victory over the Democratic nominee, who they expect to be
Governor Clinton.
