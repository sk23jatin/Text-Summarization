Articles appearing on the Wall Street Journal between July of 1991 and
January of 1992 reported on the campaign for the presidency.  They
concentrated on the Democratic candidates.

The six declared Democratic candidates were considered to be the
weakest group of candidates in several years.  They were Senators
Kerrey of Nebraska, Tsongas of Massachusetts and Harkin of Iowa, and
Governors Clinton of Arkansas and Wilder of Virginia, and ex-Governor
Brown of California.  Better known candidates, including Senator
Gore, had already dropped out of the race, probably because of Bush's
formidable approval rating after the Gulf War.  The enigmatic Governor
Cuomo of New York was hovering on the sidelines, and experts said that
he would have become the immediate front-runner if he had decided
to run.  Democratic candidates campaigned as "outsiders", but knew
that they would have to rely on "insiders to raise funds."  In
mid-December Governor Clinton won a non-binding and inconsequential
debate in Florida.  During a televised debate the same week Democrats
criticized the President's handling of the economy and called for
initiatives to help the middle class.  By late January political
experts felt that Bush's approval rating was slipping, but that he
would hold on and defeat the Democratic candidate, probably Governor
Clinton, in a close election.
