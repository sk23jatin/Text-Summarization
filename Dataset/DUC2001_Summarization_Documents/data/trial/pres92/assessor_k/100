The 1992 Democratic campaign got off to a late start.  Six candidates
remained after dropouts: Tsongas, Harkin, Kerrey, Wilder, Clinton and
Brown.  December, 1991 brought the Florida Convention and a straw
poll, a TV debate and the candidates' 1991 financial reports.  Clinton
won the poll, while the debate focused on economics and Bush's
performance.

Moderate candidates were advised to avoid a liberal label; reputed to
lose elections.  Meanwhile Democrats developed a new economic-foreign
policy approach to bolster public confidence.

Most candidates hired firms to do fund-raising.

Polls show Bush down (due to recession, Hussein); favored in November.
