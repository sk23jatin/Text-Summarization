Democratic presidential candidates, while claiming outsider status,
nevertheless employ Washington insider lawyer-lobbyists to raise money
for their campaigns.

Senator Tom Harkin, Governor Bill Clinton and Senator Robert Kerrey
rely on DC lobbyists and Kerrey has a strong Hollywood connection,
too.  Senator Tsongas, Gerry Brown and Douglas Wilder also employ
Washington lawyer-lobbyists or politicos for their fund-raising
efforts.

Democrats are behind in fundraising this year due to the recession,
Bush's high ratings and the late entry of other candidates,
particularly Governor Cuomo, while Mr. Bush has raised over $5 million
for Republicans.

Moderate Democrats who disguise themselves as liberals to win votes
often enrage the moderates, thus often losing the primaries.  By
sticking to the moderate position, a candidate may influence the
moderates, even while losing the liberals.  Four clusters of issues
are available to a moderate candidate:

1.  The party.  Let disaffected Democrats know they weren't wrong to
reject Democrats recently; blame liberal fundamentalists for scaring
away moderate Democrats.

2.  National Security.  Failure to oust Saddam Hussein, mistakes in
Russia, cutting nuclear arms, being soft on China.

3.  Race/Question affirmative action and quotas.

4.  Values.  Welfare, crime, the underclass are important issues to
moderate Democrats.

Four months before the New Hampshire Democratic primary election, the
Democratic candidates are months behind on their preparation.
Reluctant to enter the race because of the Gulf war and President
Bush's popularity, they must now master issues, assemble teams and
staff and raise money.  They must polish their messages, attend
functions and get to know the voters. Candidates Harkin, Kerrey,
Clinton, and Tsongas are all struggling to overcome their late start;
Brown and Wilder have been less active.

Strategists worry that the late start may handicap the contenders who
may not be able to present a polished alternative to Mr. Bush.

The Democratic campaign has started slow and late in Iowa, New
Hampshire and elsewhere, with few of the usual pre-primary activities,
promising a short, less costly, more intimate but difficult campaign,
especially for lesser-known candidates.

The Gulf War and Bush's high approval ratings have made Democrats
reluctant to enter; the delay may make the uphill battle against him
more difficult.

Last year's New Hampshire convention could not attract a headline
speaker and fund- raising events have been shunned. Candidates are
behind schedule in making decisions and raising money.

The shape of this campaign awaits decisions by leading campaign
figures.

Democratic presidential prospects grew dimmer today after Sen. Albert
Gore, citing family considerations, announced he won't be a candidate
in 1992.  Previous Democrats bowing out are Sens. Bill Bradley (NJ),
Jay Rockefeller, (WV), and Rep. Richard Gebhardt (MO).  Remaining in
the race is Sen. Paul Tsongas (MA); and although Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin
may declare next month, both he and Tsongas are considered underdogs
against Pres. Bush.

 Other possibilities are Gov. Mario Cuomo (NY) (who remains, however,
noncommittal), Virginias' Sen. Robb and Gov. Wilder, activist Jesse
Jackson, Gov. Brown (CA) and Gov.  Clinton of Arkansas, considered the
strongest candidate after Cuomo.

As the Florida Democratic Convention convenes, the 1991 campaign is
finally speeding up after a very late start.  It will include a
nonbinding symbolic straw poll and be followed on Sunday by a live,
nationally televised debate by current candidates Harkin, Clinton,
Brown, Wilder, Kerrey and Tsongas.  Events like this have had
important consequences in past campaigns.

In addition, next week Gov. Mario Cuomo, ahead in a recent poll, must
decide whether to run.

Also due this month are the candidates' end-of-year financial reports
to the FEC, another indicator of their standing.  All will hint at
what's going on in the campaign.

In the first nationally televised debate, six Democratic candidates
agreed to help middle class Americans and while disagreeing on other
issues, all attacked President Bush.  Gov.  Brown chided Congressmen
as creatures of special interest and policical action committee money.

Gov. Cuomo, while on everybody's minds, was not mentioned.

Governor Clinton, who won the straw poll in Florida, praised Bush for
the Gulf War; Kerrey disagreed. Candidates opposed Japan's trade
policies and approved humanitarian aid to former Soviet Russia,
national health reform, and help for working class Americans.  Clinton
and Wilder favor middle class tax cuts; Harkin disagreed, favoring
more public works projects.

The recession has led to public demands for action on the economy.
The six Democratic presidential candidates have responded by calling
for tax cuts, incentives for investments and savings, tax breaks and
government spending to end the recession and reduce the deficit.
Three questions dominate: how to end the recession, restore government
growth/competitiveness, and address middle-class concerns?

A middle-class tax cut is the solution being advocated by Clinton,
Wilder, Kerrey and Brown, while Harkin strongly urges government
investment in infrastructure.  Tsongas would invest in technology,
Kerrey in health care reform.

All candidates urge that the Fed lower interest rates.

In 1992 the Democratic candidates are blurring the distinction between
foreign and domestic policy to convince Americans of their capability
in National Security issues.  Their goal, through various plans, would
be to enhance American economic well-being by creating new
international markets, even as they offer aid to struggling nations.

They hope this approach may deflect the debate over many Democrats's
opposition to the Gulf War (seen by the public as a success) and also
to portray Bush as unable to deflect defense spending to cope with a
different, post-cold war world.

A Wall Street Journal panel of political experts feel that President
Bush is in deep trouble in the re-election campaign.

The economy is plunging and Saddam Hussein is still in power.
Furthermore, Bush has made some recent errors by taking too much blame
for the economy and taking high- powered businessmen along on his last
trip to Asia.  Another error was facing Pat Buchanan in New Hampshire,
legitimizing his candidacy.

The panel feels the Democratic slate is the weakest in years, however,
and unless a strong candidate, such as Governor Cuomo, enters, the
race will be close, but Bush will win.
