the debate focused on economic strategies and middle class tax breaks.
All participants attacked Bush.

The Wall Street Journal advised moderates to cling to their

Democrats, in response to national security concerns, developed a
combination domestic/foreign policy, stressing new economic markets
overseas.  Most condidates responded to the deficit and recession by
favoring tax cuts and increased federal spending.

To assist with their own campaign financing, most, while calling

economy and Sadaam Hussein still in power.  They predict a close
election but a Bush victory.
