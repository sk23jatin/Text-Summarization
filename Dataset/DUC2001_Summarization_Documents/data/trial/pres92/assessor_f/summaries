In July 1991, no prominent Democrats are active in Iowa and New Hampshire,
states with early caucuses or primaries.  This late start for the 1992
presidential race may lead to a less costly and more issue oriented race
than recent contests.  President Bush's high approval ratings after the
Gulf War has kept Democrats out of the race thus far. Some potential candidates
have important stops on the money trail, visiting Democratic fund raisers
assembled in Maryland and at the home of Pamela Harriman. Speculation
centers on Gov. Cuomo of NY; others mentioned: Jesse Jackson, Sen's. Gore,
Harkin and Rockefeller, and Governors Clinton and Wilder.

Democratic presidential prospects dimmed further with the dropout of
Sen. Al Gore for family reasons.  The only currently announced
candidate is former Senator Tsongas.  Iowa's liberal Senator Harkin is
likely to declare next month (September).  The Gore action again turns
speculation to Gov. Cuomo despite his clear weaknesses: identification
as a northern liberal and his state's financial woes.  Other than
Cuomo, the most promising possible aspirant may be Arkansas Gov. Bill
Clinton, a telegenic campaigner who has won praise for his
accomplishment's as governor.  Gore insisted that if not for family
considerations he would run since he believes President Bush
vulnerable.

The liberal wing of the Democratic Party dominates the presidential
nominating process.  But only a moderate candidate could successfully
compete with Republicans in the sun belt and west.  Moderate Democrats
who neglect their base and woo liberals risk losing moderate voters
and probably fail to attract liberals.  Senators Hollings, Glenn, and
Gore and Gov. Babbitt, the moderates of 1988, failed in this respect.
Liberals (Mondale and Dukakis) who become moderates aren't credible in
the Republican stronghold.  Gov Bill Clinton is the moderate
alternative for 1992.  He has touched on issues which could bring back
disaffected Democrats: blaming liberals; positioning to the right of
President Bush on national security and foreign policy; questioning
racial quotas and affirmative action; and stressing values.

Democratic presidential candidates all claim the mantle of "outsider"
but most head for the Beltway insiders when it comes to raising money.
Senator Harkin of Iowa appears to be the candidate favored by
Washington's lobbying community.  Gov Bill Clinton emphasizes his
Southern "outsider" base but has many notables on his committee.  Sen.
Kerrey of Nebraska has fewer beltway ties, but has an "in" in
Hollywood.  Former Sen. Tsongas has several lawyer-lobbyists helping
him with fund raising.  Former Gov. Jerry Brown has a few Washington
politicos helping him but doesn't accept contribution over $100.  Gov.
Cuomo, believed to have great fund-raising potential remains on the
sideline.  President Bush, however, exceeds the Democrats fund raising
abilities.

Democratic presidential hopefuls not only trail President Bush in the
polls but haven't yet assembled campaign teams and become familiar to
issues important to New Hampshire voters.  Money raising and spending
lags that of previous campaigns.  Sen Harkin is running strong but Gov.
Clinton, Sen Kerrey, and Paul Tsongas have just begun appearing at
mandatory stops in New Hampshire.  Gov. Cuomo, Rev. Jesse Jackson,
former Gov. Brown, and Gov. Wilder remain on the sidelines.  All
potential candidates are assessed to be on an equal footing at this
point.  Experienced campaign operatives believe that there are
resources waiting, ready and willing, to be tapped.

Florida's Democrats have a weekend convention starting December 13
that includes a non-binding straw poll of delegates.  The six
announced candidates will then meet for a debate on NBC.  Most of the
candidates downplay the significance of the straw vote.  One observer
says that "Money is the first primary." "If you have it, you are a
viable candidate".  The burst of year-end activity is viewed as an
opportunity for Gov. Clinton, to consolidate his position as the
leading alternative to Gov. Cuomo, the most popular Democrat, who has
yet to decide on the race.  But Clinton must really zoom ahead says a
former Mondale supporter.

The six declared Democratic candidates for President attacked President
Bush in a Tow Brokaw-moderated session the day following a straw
poll of Florida Democratic Delegates.  The "debaters" were Gov's.
Clinton and Wilder, former Gov. Jerry Brown, Sen's. Harkin and Kerrey,
and former Senator Tsongas.  All agreed on the need to help
middle-class Americans but gingerly attacked each others positions on
other key issues.  Gov. Cuomo, still considering the race, must soon
declare if he wants to be in the New Hampshire.  Gov. Clinton won a
majority of votes in the non-binding straw poll which his opponents
derided as insignificant.

Recent Democratic Presidential nominees have failed to make a a case
for dealing with the Reagan deficits.  However, 1992 is different: a
deficit greater then ever and a prolonged recession have raised public
demands for government action. This year's Democratic hopefuls are
stressing middle-class tax cuts and investment spending to rally the
economy.  Also they favor incentives for investmate and savings, and
spending on health, education, transportation, roads, and high-tech
telecommunications.  All favor easier credit policy than the Federal
Reserve has pursued under chairman Alan Greenspan.  The collapse of
the Soviet Union also may portend a diversion of spending from
Defense.

In the 1992 election, domestic concerns will dominate.  Democratic
contenders will try to blur the distinction between foreign policy,
President Bush's strong suit, and domestic policy.  They want to
portray foreign policy as a tool to advance America's economic
well-being, not simply to protect America physically.  Democrats will
portray Bush as locked into a "Cold War Mentality" unable to redirect
spending.  This may be a pitfall.  Bush's favorable ratings derived
from the Gulf War, which some Democrats opposed.  Most Democrats favor
loan guarantees to Israel for support to emigrating Soviet Jews and
some called for help to the former Soviet Union dismantle nuclear
weapons.

Republican strategists view the Democratic contenders as the weakest
in years but concede that President Bush is in trouble because of the
economy.  The President is off to a terrible start; the strategists
say he shouldn't apologize so many times about his record.  Reagan was
known as the "Teflon Man" but Bush is the "Velcro Man" who absorbs
anything that goes wrong.  The President is falling in the polls and
Pat Buchanan is a threat.  The best news for the Republicans is that
they view the Democratic contenders as unimpressive with Gov. Clinton
as the strongest.  The economy will be the one big issue.
