Democratic Presidential hopefuls were late in beginning their
campaigns, assembling staffs, and formulating issues.  Governor Cuomo
never entered the race.  Senators Harkin, Gore, Kerrey and
Rockefeller; Governors Wilder and Clinton; and Jesse Jackson ran or
had considered running.  After a Florida Democratic Convention and a
debate following, Governor Clinton began to emerge from the pack and
was considered the Moderate candidate.  Democrats found domestic
issues rather than national security could dominate the
campaign. President Bush's high ratings from the Gulf War dropped as
the deficit and state of the economy became the main issue and
Republican strategists conceded that he was in trouble.
