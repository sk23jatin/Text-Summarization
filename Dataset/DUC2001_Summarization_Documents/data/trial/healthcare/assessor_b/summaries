Last year America's health-care costs were approximately 12% of the
nation's gross national product.

Senate Democrats, wanting health-care to be a critical issue in next
year's presidential campaign, have introduced a bill to overhaul the
health-care system by limiting spending and providing insurance for
everyone.

The bill would require employers to either provide core health
benefits for all employees or pay a tax to finance coverage for the
un-insured.  The bill would establish an independent board to set
annual targets for health-care spending.

This Senate bill is unlikely to be enacted in its current form.
Republicans are trying to reach consensus on their own health-care
proposal.

Many Americans believe that the U.S. health-care system is ailing.
More than 30 million people do not have health insurance.

Senate Majority Leader Mitchell vowed to pass legislation this year
overhauling the nation's health-care system.  The Democrats' proposal
would require employers to offer insurance coverage to their employees
or contribute to a new government program called Americare which would
replace the current Medicaid for the poor.  It would insure anyone not
covered by an employer plan.

Republicans denounce the idea of requiring employers to provide
coverage. Principals deny they are using the health-care issue for
political advantage; but, politics is in the air.

American medicine needs reform.  How to pay and distribute costs
fairly, how to place reasonable limits on costs and how to ensure care
is reliable and well administered are difficult questions.

We can learn from the experience of other nations.  Citizens of nine
industrial countries are more satisfied with their systems than
U.S. citizens are with ours.  The governmental systems of Australia,
Canada and West Germany all have user-responsive, decentralized
features and are less costly than ours.  However, experts disagree
whether other nations' solutions can resolve any uniquely American
care problems such as greater poverty, more violent cities and higher
biomedical research costs.

Although Democrats see health-care reform as a major campaign issue,
Republicans differ on its importance and seem reluctant to act.  Some
Republicans believe that "health care is to the '90s what taxes were
to the '80s."  Other Republicans cite an ABC News poll which indicates
that those who identify heath care as their primary concern mainly
fall into typically Democratic Party constituencies.  Therefore,
Mr. Sununu believes heath-care is a losing game for the GOP.  He
states that the Democrats will always, "up the ante" -- promising more
benefits and coverage with little regard to cost.  Republicans
inevitably will be cast as a bunch of Scrooges.

A nationwide Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll of 1006 registered
voters indicates that 4 of 10 believe that health-care ranks first or
second of six pressing national issues. Further, 51% say it's the
government's responsibility to solve the problem.  A 55% majority
believes the biggest problem with the current system is high cost; 32%
say the greatest problem is the number of un-insured.  In Congress,
Democrats argue that Republicans are too slow in addressing the
problem.  Republicans argue that anything the Democrats come up with
is too costly.  This split has been a barrier to a politically
acceptable comprehensive reform plan.

Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan today indicated
that the Bush administration is unlikely to propose a major overhaul
of America's health-care system.  He stated that broad revisions such
as a national federally sponsored health care plan or the requirement
that employers either provide coverage to employees or pay a tax to
finance public health, "would be inflationary, smother competition and
lead to rationing and waiting lists."

Instead, Sullivan today called for a summit of insurance company
executives to discuss ways of cutting administrative costs.  The Bush
administration will push for limited fixes and incremental changes.

One reason America does not have national health insurance is that the
majority of citizens have resisted subsidizing those who are unable to
afford it or to force coverage on those who do not obtain it
voluntarily.  An important question is whether national health
coverage would improve the health of the population.  International
evidence indicates that national health insurance does not eliminate
or even substantially reduce differentials in health outcomes across
socioeconomic groups.  It does, however, seem to reduce health costs
by "upstream resource allocation" i.e., governmental control of
capital investment, specialty mix of physicians and the development
and diffusion of high-cost medical technology.

In a public debate about health care reform among six Democratic
presidential candidates, it seems that only Senator Bob Kerry of
Nebraska managed to seize the issue.  He advanced a plan to
dramatically alter the current health-care system by uncoupling
insurance coverage from employment.  He would federalize the financing
of insurance by taxing employers and employees and then have states
distribute the money to qualified health plans.  Senator Tsongas of
Massachusetts also offered a fairly detailed plan.  The others, Tom
Harkin, Bill Clinton, Doug Wilder and Jerry Brown, although
criticizing the problems of our current system, had little to offer as
solutions.

Republicans and Democrats are taking very different paths toward
health-care reform.  Everyone agrees that with skyrocketing prices and
over 30 million un-insured citizens, our current system is ailing.
However, Republicans feel strongly that it should remain primarily a
private, market based system with reform enabled through tax
incentives and tax credits designed to promote improvements.
Conversely, Democrats feel greater governmental regulation and
involvement is needed.  They endorse a Canadian style system or a less
drastic "play or pay" plan whereby employers must provide insurance
coverage to employees or, alternatively, pay a tax to finance coverage
for the un-insured.  These very differing philosophies are proving
difficult to reconcile.

President Bush proposed a $100 billion, multi-faceted health care plan
to help small businesses.  Some entrepreneurs embraced portions of the
plan.  Others remained skeptical that it sufficiently addresses their
primary concern -- high costs.  "I saw the President's proposal and
watched the Democratic response, and I'm not very impressed with
either of them," said Robert Winet, president of a Santa Monica, CA
small business.  Susan Hagar, president of a small business lobbying
group said that for any reform proposal to be sound, it has to address
cost containment, access to health care and quality.  "But so far, no
one has come up with the answer," she added.
