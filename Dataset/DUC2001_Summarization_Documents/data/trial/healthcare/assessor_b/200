In American over 30 million citizens are uninsured and heath-care
costs are skyrocketing.  Health-care reform has emerged as a hot
political issue.  Both parties are staking out their positions.

Democrats claim we will have reform legislation enacted before the end
of the year. Two Democratic plans currently hold sway.  The first is a
federally controlled, Canadian style national health-care system.
Everyone would receive government paid benefits. But the government
would control the providers fees and total health-care costs.  The
second plan would require all employers to either provide basic
health-care benefits for employees or pay a tax to enable the federal
government to provide those benefits to the uninsured.

Republicans believe that the Democratic Party plans voiced thus far
are too complex or too expensive. Republicans' long-standing
philosophy has been that our health-care system should remain mostly
private and market based.  The Bush Administration's position is that
reform should not be structural or dramatic.  Rather, multi-faceted,
incremental improvements based on free market, competitive mechanisms
and governmental tax incentives and tax credits to encourage change is
the only politically acceptable route.

Politicians recognize that our health-care problems need attention.
However, due to differing views on possible solutions, reform may not
occur anytime soon.
