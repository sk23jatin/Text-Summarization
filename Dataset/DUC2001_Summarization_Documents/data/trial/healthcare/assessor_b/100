Over 30 million American citizens are uninsured and heath-care costs
are skyrocketing.  Both political parties are discussing health-care
reform.

One Democratic sponsored plan is a federally controlled, Canadian
style national health-care system.  Another would require all
employers to either provide basic health-care benefits for all
employees or pay a tax to enable the federal government to provide
those benefits to the uninsured.

Republicans believe that the Democratic Party plans are too complex
and expensive. The Bush Administration believes that reform should
consist of incremental improvements based on free market, competitive
mechanisms coupled with governmental tax incentives and tax credits to
encourage improvements.
