   WASHINGTON -- Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan called for a summit with the chief executives of
major insurance companies to discuss ways of paring the
administrative costs of health care.
   But in a speech here, Dr. Sullivan indicated that the Bush
administration isn't likely to put forth a broad legislative
proposal to overhaul the country's health-care system.
Rather, he advocated focusing on ways to improve the current
system.

   Administration health officials said the meeting with
insurers, tentatively scheduled for Nov. 5, is likely to
commence a series of discussions with players in the nation's
$670 billion health-care system on problems of cost and
access. Administrative costs, like excessive paper work, have
burdened the health-care system with billions of dollars in
unnecessary costs, many observers believe. Some studies have
put the price at more than $100 billion a year, but HHS
officials believe it is more like $15 billion to $25 billion.
   While numerous health-care reform proposals have been
introduced in Congress this year -- mostly by Democrats --
the comments of Dr. Sullivan and other HHS officials
yesterday suggest the Bush administration isn't interested in
striving for systematic revision and will push for limited
fixes and incremental changes.
   "I will not propose another grand, sweeping, speculative
scheme," Dr. Sullivan said. "Rather, I want a public debate
to focus on some immediate, practical options that address
our most urgent healthcare concerns."
   Some of the options, he said, are:
   -- Making health insurance more affordable to small
businesses.
   -- Easing barriers to "high quality, cost-effective
managed and coordinated care."
   -- Researching the effectiveness of various medical
procedures to encourage the use of the most cost-effective
ones.
   -- Altering the tax code to "increase consumer awareness
of the true cost of health care and distribute current tax
subsidies more equally." Among other things, administration
officials have been looking at the possibility of limiting
the tax exemption for employer-paid health insurance
premiums.
   -- Increasing the availability of primary care to the
neediest people.
   -- Reducing the administrative costs of health care.
   The U.S. spends more per capita on health care than any
country, yet more than 30 million Americans lack health
insurance. In January 1989, President Bush ordered an
administration task force to study problems of health and
access, but it has yet to propose solutions.
   Dr. Sullivan repeated his dislike for the two most widely
discussed health-care revision proposals: establishing a
nationwide federally sponsored health-care system, similar to
Canada's; or mandating employers to either provide basic
health benefits to workers or pay a tax to finance a public
health plan. Such approaches, he said, would be inflationary,
"smother competition," and lead to "rationing and waiting
lists."
   He said experimentation in health-care reform should be
left to the states. "Local solutions for local problems
should be our working philosophy, as should learning from
local mistakes in order to avoid harm to the nation as a
whole," he said.
