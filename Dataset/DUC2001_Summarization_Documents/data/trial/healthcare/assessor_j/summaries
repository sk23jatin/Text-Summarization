Senate democrats are preparing to introduce legislation to overhaul
the health care system by limiting spending and providing insurance
for everybody.  The bill also would establish an independent board
called the national health care expenditure board which would
negotiate spending limits for health care providers and recipients.
the democrats want to make health care an issue in the presidential
campaign.  This is pushed by spiraling prices and the fact that 30
million americans lack health insurance of any kind.  Other highlights
of the plan include: replacing medicaid with a program called
americare, americare users would pay according to ability and would be
financed by a tax on payrolls of employers who dont provide health
insurance.

Senate democratic leader George Mitchell vowed to pass legislation
overhauling the nation`s health system by the end of the year.
 
The proposal would require employers to offer health coverage to
their employees or contribute to a new public health-insurance plan.
This contribution would be in the form of a payroll tax which would be
set by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.  The tax would fund
a new government health-insurance program called Americare, which
would replace the current Medicaid program for the poor. Americare
would insure anyone not covered by an employer plan.  To curb health
costs, the bill would set up an independent board that would negotiate
national health-care spending goals.

Three recent mevents: the Democratic Senate leaders plan for universal
health insurance, the AMA statement that American health care requires
substantial reform, and the General Accounting Office`s endiorsement
of the canadian medical insurance model, have put medical reform in
the news.  The American public has been well ahead of the above groups
in saying that the system needs fundamental change.  The principle
complaints of the public are: spiraling costs, incomplete coverage,
and the baffling array of insurance plans and policies.  As to costs
Americans spend 12.2% of their gross national product on medical care,
while Canada and Germany only spend 9%. Add to this the fact that 30
to 40 million americanshave no health coverage at all.

The Bush administration`s approach to Democratic proposals for reform
can best be capsuled in the attitudes of Chief of Staff John Sununu
who complained in a meetin with AMA officials at the White House that
the doctors were too sympathetic to the Democratic proposals to
overhaul the health-care system.  In contrast is the attitude of
another Bush official Budget Director Richard Darman who argues that
the Administration should come up with a comprehensive health-care
-reform plan befire the 1992 election.  GOP pollster Bill McInturff
dismissed the topis as not being a big issue in the Republican
coalition since those to whome health care was a primary concern were
four subgroups: the uninsured, the the poor, Hispaniucs and blacks.

A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found voters deeply
dissatisfied with the current health care system and willing to
embrace a broad range of solutions,including compelling all employers
to extend health benefits, imposinga tax increase if it would address
the problem of skyrocketing medical costs, and even adopting a
Canadian-style, government-paid health system.  The voters viewed
health care as one of the country`s most urgent domestic concerns.
High costs and the number of uninsured Americans were cited as two of
the biggest problems.  The respondants blamed equally insurance
companies, doctors, and hospitals for the problem, but they were
unanimous in responding that it is the federal government`s
responsibility to solve the problem.

Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan called for a simmit
with chief executives of major insurance companies to descus ways of
cutting administrative costs of health care. Sullivan indicated that
the Bush administration is not likely to go for a broad legislative
program to remake the health care system, but rather on ways to
improve the current system. as an example cutting administrative costs
which some say reaches more than $100 billion per year. Dr,
Sullivanwants to focus on practical options to meet the most immediate
concerns,such as:making health insurance more affordable to small
businesses,removing barriers toquality care,studyingmedical procedures
to focus on the most effective,increasing care to the neediest,and
reducing admin costs.

Victor Fuchs, Professor of economics at Stanford University offers
some tgoughts in the current furor regarding a national health care
system.
The American system is primarily voluntary, with medicare being the
only exception.  Most Americans have private insurance with the
exception of the large group of uninsured.  Fuchs classifies them in
six categories: the poor, the sick and disabled, the difficult, the
low users the gamblers,and the free riders.  National health insurance
then, in his view, the subsidization of those who cannot afford
insurance and the compulsion of those who are unwilling to acquire it.
Americans generally resist both subsidization or forcing.  The need to
curb costs may be the final push into a national system.

A gathering of Democratic presidential candidates in Nashua,N,H.was
dedicated to presentation of health care reform proposals.  The
meeting was limited to this topic. Sen. Bob Kerry offered the most
detailed proposal. His plan would alter the present system of
financing care by uncoupling health insurance coverage from employment
which mean tha an employees' coveragewould follow in any job changes
,loss of a job or being employed by a company that had a poorer
insurance plan. It provided for a commission to regulate costs and the
money would be would be allocated to the states who would distribute
it. His plan would eliminate Medicare and Medicaid. Sen. tsongas's
planwas more conventional inits approach.

President Bush is on the verge of igniting an ideological battle in
entering the battleto fix the ailing health care system.  at the core
the problem involves the political philosophies of the two political
parties: the republicans feel that market forces can solve the problem
while the Democrats feel that only the government has the clout to
bring about real reform. The two main factors driving this question
are runaway costs and limited access. T . The democrats favor a more
Canadian like system where the government pays for all medical needs
and regulates all providers. The Mitchell plan is the nearest approach
to the Canadian plan.

President Bush announced his $100 billion plan toreform the health
care system. Small business people praised certain proposals, such as
:tax credits for workers who pay their own insurance and his proposal
for new Health Insurance Networks to achieve pooled purchasing
power. He also proposed letting self-employed people deduct 100% of
health insurance costs against income. Reaction to Mr. Bush`s proposal
was varied. One spokesperson said that any inducement to spread the
costs by cimbining small businesses is excellent.  Some gave the
proposal a cool reception: one did not like the idea of capping
Medicare and Medicaid payments, others felt more drastic steps were
needed ,such as national insurance program.
