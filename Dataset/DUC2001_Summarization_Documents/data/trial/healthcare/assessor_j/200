The American public was sensitized to the need for reform of the
health care system by the high cost of American health care at 12.2%
of the GNP while Canada and Germany only paid 9%.  Inaddition the need
to do something about the nearly 40 million fellow Americans with no
health insurance could not be ignored.  The Democratic leader in the
Senate, George Mitchell responded to this call for reforn with an
universal health care plan.  The essential featuresof this plan were:
requirement that all employers offer health plans or if not that they
contribute to a new public health insurance plan by means of a pay
roll tax set by the government.  This tax would fund a new program
called Americare which would replace Medicaid.  A new national health
care expenditure board would monitor costs.  Sen. Bob Kerry offered a
plan which added the feature of mobility to employer insurance
coverage, wherein an employee could retain coverage if he moved to a
new job or lost his job.  The Bush administration initially felt that
a fine tuning of the existing system would do, but later came out with
limited health plan in time fore the 1992 elections.
