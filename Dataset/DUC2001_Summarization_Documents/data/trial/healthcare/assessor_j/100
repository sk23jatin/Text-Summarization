The high cost of health care and the fact that almost 40 million
Americans had no health insurance focused the country`s attention on
this issue.  The Democratic leadership in the Senate responded with an
universal health care proposal which would require all employers to
offer health plans,or,if not, to pay a pay roll tax set by a
governmentagency.  This tax would finance anew public health insurance
program called Americare which would replace Medicaid.  After trying
to ignore the problem, the Bush administration tried to finesse it
with proposals to fine tune the existing system to control costs and
finally to take some tentative steps toward reform.
